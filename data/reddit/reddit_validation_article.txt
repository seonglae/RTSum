0	0	A man tried to mug me and I proceeded to beat the ever loving shit out of him for it.
0	1	It was a fight or flight reflex and my instant, unthinking reaction was to go completely berserk.
0	2	I kind of blacked out and had to be pulled off the guy and his whole face was bloody and he was unconscious.
0	3	I got arrested and questioned and the police let me go because he decided not to press charges.
0	4	My reaction was above and beyond acceptable force, hence the possibility of me being charged with a crime.
0	5	Honestly I don't regret it.
0	6	Maybe the mother fucker will think twice before he approaches a 5'2" woman and thinks he can scare her into turning over what little money she has.
1	0	When I was a freshman in high school I showed up one day and almost everyone was silent.
1	1	I asked a few friends what was going on and apparently a girl (Senior) died in a car accident.
1	2	I felt kinda sad to see so many people mourning, but really just didn't let it bother me.
1	3	The name sounded familiar, but I didn't think anything of it because I already hear so many names.
1	4	I go to my first period and the announcements come on and the principal says a few words about the girl.
1	5	One of her friends in front of me cries.
1	6	My second period is English I.
1	7	My teacher (who I hated) has been crying, saying that she really cares about us, etc.
1	8	She had the girl as a student.
1	9	I can't really remember third period but fourth period is Piano I. I go to my piano class
1	10	and I see my guidance counselor in the window.
1	11	Out of 10 students, 6 are seniors.
1	12	I go in and sit down at my usual seat.
1	13	My guidance counselor is crying of course and saying that she is going through all of the girl's classes to comfort students.
1	14	That's when I stopped and looked around.
1	15	No one was absent except for the girl who was supposed to be next to me.
1	16	The girl who always complained about her job at Panera, helped me with songs I was trying to learn, shared music with me, read the papers I wrote.
1	17	I never even took the time to learn her name.
1	18	I felt horrible.
1	19	People were just looking at me for crying out of nowhere.
1	20	I'm usually pretty emotionless when it comes to these kinds of things but at that moment I realized what the hell was going on and who had died and felt genuinely sad to the point of tears.
2	0	I've told this story before on Reddit, but it's still creepy to me and probably fits here just as well.
2	1	I had a girlfriend in high school whose step father had sexually abused her when she was younger.
2	2	She had told me about it so I knew.
2	3	She also would talk in her sleep.
2	4	And not just say random things, she would start dreaming, then start talking and you could talk back to her.
2	5	She would talk to you but not wake up.
2	6	One afternoon, she fell asleep and started talking.
2	7	She kinda started to whine, then said 'help'.
2	8	I asked what she needed help with.
2	9	She was telling me that she was in her kitchen and that he was in his room.
2	10	He wanted to play the game.
2	11	I told her that I was just outside, all she had to do was come outside and I would save her.
2	12	She continued to whine, and told me she'd get in trouble.
2	13	I tried to convince her a couple times to come outside to me, but she wouldn't do it.
2	14	She was really sounding stressed
2	15	so I woke her up.
2	16	It was really weird and I felt so terrible for her.
2	17	I told her what had happened and she just cried.
2	18	It may not seem all that creepy like some of the stories here, but damn, when it's happening to you, you really get weirded out by it.
3	0	When I was in high school I went on vacation with family and bought my then girlfriend earrings to surprise her with when i got back.
3	1	I came back to her introducing me to her new boyfriend and me subsequently being kicked to the curb.
3	2	2 years later we got to talking over facebook and I initiated a booty call.
3	3	Afterwords, She told me she had feelings for me again and i responded with "cool, i'm late for dinner, talk to you later" BEST MASHED POTATOES EVER WERE HAD.
4	0	When I was a child my family moved to a big old two-floor house, with big empty rooms and creaking floorboards.
4	1	Both my parents worked so I was often alone when I came home from school.
4	2	One early evening when I came home the house was still dark.
4	3	I called out, "Mum?
4	4	" and heard her sing song voice say "Yeeeeees?
4	5	" from upstairs.
4	6	I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in, and again got the same "Yeeeeees?
4	7	" reply.
4	8	We were decorating at the time, and I didn't know my way around the maze of rooms but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall.
4	9	I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural
4	10	so I rushed forward to see my mum, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother's presence always does.
4	11	Just as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself in to the room I heard the front door downstairs open and my mother call "Sweetie, are you home?
4	12	" in a cheery voice.
4	13	I jumped back, startled and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack.
4	14	For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don't know what it was, but it was staring at me.
5	0	Here goes.
5	1	I've always had a bit of paranormal problems in my life.
5	2	This is a reddit post, so I'll give the abridged and cut to the good parts.
5	3	The most significant first incident was seeing my dead grandfather.
5	4	This was at night, I was nine at the time I believe, so I'm in my bed with the door slightly ajar
5	5	so I can still see the nightlight in the hallway.
5	6	Stuffed animal cuddled by my side.
5	7	Wake up in the middle of the night.. for no apparent reason.
5	8	Usually I would only take up to use the bathroom, which is why there was a nightlight in the hall.
5	9	I look around..
5	10	it's all dim, as it tends to be in the middle of the night.
5	11	And then I notice that the light in the hallway is different.
5	12	Moving, even.
5	13	My first impulse is to freak out about someone being in the house.
5	14	It looks, at first, like it could've been a flashlight of someone coming up the stairs reflecting off the wall and making the light in the hallway strange.
5	15	But it's getting brighter.. and there's no sound on the stairs.
5	16	The door opens by itself / is pushed open by this glowy.. orb of light, roughly the size of a basketball.
5	17	And immediately my intruder panic has become a mix of bewilderment and calm.
5	18	The light is very calming.
5	19	It drifts over, and "sits" on the bed; not making contact with the mattress but hovering just above it towards the foot of my bed and making the bed shift slightly as if weight had been put on it.
5	20	And it just sits there a moment.
5	21	And I watch.
5	22	And then it leaves.
5	23	It heads back out into the hallway, this time heading down towards my mother's room.
5	24	As soon as it's gone, PANIC takes hold.. but it just went down the hallway towards my mother's room, so that's no good.
5	25	I roll over away from the door, pulling the covers over my head and cuddling my stuffed animal overtime.
5	26	The next morning...
5	27	I tell my mom about what I assume was a really weird dream (REALLY weird, because at that age the only dreams I remembered were nightmares and they never resembled real world places).
5	28	Mom breaks out in tears, pulls me into a hug.. and explains that she saw her father (my dead grandfather) come into her room, sit on her bed and tell her it was all going to be okay.
5	29	She sent me out to play after that, and called her friends.
5	30	We didn't talk about the incident much afterwards.
5	31	A few years after that experience, I met a.. person.
5	32	I only met her once in person, but shortly after meeting her she appeared in my dreams.
5	33	Consistently.
5	34	Every night, for YEARS.
5	35	She told me that she was there, in my dreams, to help me learn how to dream better.
5	36	Specifically, to control the shape and the flow of my dreams; teaching me precise control of lucid dreaming.
5	37	This all happened when I was about 13 or so, and lasted until I was 18 when a problem developed in the dreams.
5	38	During my time with her, every night was a lucid dream that I remembered vividly the next day.
5	39	Sight, sound, sometimes even smell and taste worked properly in the dream world.
5	40	I had no problems reading text, and I never encountered any "random crap" that people typically have in their dreams.
5	41	I had complete control over energy, matter and time within the dream space.
5	42	I have never spoken to anyone that had lucid capacity as well as I had it, and many people claim what I experienced was impossible.
5	43	I've had other experiences.. but this is running long.
5	44	I haven't seen evidence that Reddit is very paranormally inclined, so I usually keep it to myself.
6	0	I found a wallet outside of the busiest restaurant in town at 7am
6	1	A few people kept walking past it and I sat on a bench and watched as people just ignored it.
6	2	After 15 minutes I picked it up.
6	3	He had somebody else's credit card in there, many food stamps and a drivers license.
6	4	To put it bluntly, he looked like white trash.
6	5	I google mapped his location and found out he lived 4 towns away in what resembled a shed.
6	6	This sounded like the kind of guy who would give me a bag of coke for this back, so I didn't give it back.
6	7	I burnt it.
6	8	Go me.
7	0	My sister used to work at a Jamba Juice.
7	1	One day, a lady came in asking for a smoothie original size.
7	2	My sister accidentally made too much and ended up giving the lady a power sized smoothie (one size larger than the original).
7	3	When the lady received the smoothie, she went up to my sister and said "I asked for an original.
7	4	" My sister replied "Yeah, I'm so sorry.
7	5	I accidentally made too much.
7	6	You only got charged for an original though
7	7	so the rest of it is free.
7	8	" The lady responded "How am I supposed to drink more than I wanted?
7	9	" and then proceeded to pour the entire smoothie onto the floor and walked out.
8	0	Me and my friends were hanging at a park at about 11 PM, playing some sort of hide-and-seek version of a game.
8	1	I had a pretty awesome hiding spot, so I could've stayed where I was.
8	2	My friend got attacked by a group of 8 black men in their early 20s.
8	3	I ran at them, yelling to hopefully get rid of them, and told them that I had already called the cops (I hadn't).
8	4	A couple of them stood further back, but a small group of them got in my face and wanted $20 from me (I was broke).
8	5	After it started looking worse for me, I try explaining that I was broke.
8	6	So I took out my wallet and let them look.
8	7	And while one of them is looking into the wallet that I had opened, showing them, one of the men punched me in the face.
8	8	My jaw was pretty messed up for a month or so (Swollen, couldnt eat without terrible pain.
8	9	This happened two years ago too and my jaw still makes an obnoxious popping noise when I eat.
8	10	)
8	11	The other friend of mine took off his shirt and started freaking out on them.
8	12	They all took off in a van after that without getting anything out of me or my two friends.
8	13	Afterwards me and my shirtless friend were still processing what had happened because it happened so fast.
8	14	As we were calming down, we noticed that my friend's car was gone.
8	15	The friend that was first attacked that I came out of hiding for.
8	16	Not only did he leave us while we stepped in to help him, he went to Taco Bell to get a drink of water.
8	17	We could've been killed for all he knew and he didn't go for help?
8	18	And this sounds stupid, but I only filed a police report to help kids younger than me.
8	19	Im also in my early 20's and there aren't any lights over the park.
8	20	So I never expected to find the people that mugged me because it was dark and very hard to identify the people there.
8	21	My local paper published a short story of what happened on their website, and all of the comments on it were accusing me and my friends (we're white) of making this story up to start a town-wide racial battle, or make it something bigger than it was.
8	22	Others said with confidence that it was a drug deal gone bad.
8	23	The whole thing was a headache but the people reading and posting on the story probably have kids, and they don't understand that my only motive was trying to protect their kids from people I thought we would never catch.
9	0	As I stated in another thread, I used to take claims for an auto insurance company.
9	1	I was a temporary subcontracted employee who only worked there for maybe six months.
9	2	They told us we would get a maximum of one casualty claim a year, more likely people go years without ever taking a casualty claim.
9	3	It's more like "someone backed into me, there's paint missing" type stuff.
9	4	Now before you go getting all "oh god it's going to be horribly gruesome," yes, it is a death of someone, but it's so hilariously ironic I don't think of it that way.
9	5	This woman had an old POS car that was stolen.
9	6	She had called the company to make us aware that her car had been stolen, but didn't bother filing a claim until the police were able to locate the car, to find out if it was repairable or not.
9	7	I get the follow up call where they've found the car and she's calling to report the "accident.
9	8	" So about two weeks goes by, they finally locate the car.
9	9	Basically what happened is the car was stolen, where it was driven a short distance.
9	10	It then went over a cliff, a hundred feet down, into a ravine.
9	11	It sat in a ravine for two weeks, filled with water, before police noticed, located, and removed it.
9	12	Okay that sucks, right?
9	13	Yeah, well what about the car thief?
9	14	Strapped securely in the front seat with the seatbelt on and everything.
9	15	Under water.
9	16	For two weeks.
9	17	I never saw the closing notes for that claim but I'm gonna go ahead and say they totaled that car.
10	0	Okay, some nautical creepiness for you.
10	1	Maybe more weird than creepy but it spooked me.
10	2	I was in the Coast Guard for 4 years, two of them spent on a 210' Cutter home-ported in NC, so we did a lot of patrols in the Caribbean, and naturally, we passed through the Bermuda triangle frequently.
10	3	Before you call bs or aliens, the Caribbean and anywhere near the Sargasso sea can be pretty spooky on it's own right.
10	4	I'm talking dead calm conditions where the sea melts into the horizon and it looks like you are trapped in a huge sphere of blue, freak squalls that come up surprisingly quickly, St. Elmo's fire, you name it.
10	5	Anyways, we (me and the rest of deck department) would have to stand watch for 4 hours at all times of day, either 4 hours standing up manning the helm or 4 hours up on the flying bridge standing lookout.
10	6	I was frequently stuck on the 4-8's (4am to 8am) the very definition of the graveyard watch.
10	7	So one night I'm on helm, in the Bermuda triangle, and the quartermaster asks me for a compass check (where you look in a little window at the magnetic compass reading), and it's spinning rapidly.
10	8	It sent a chill down my spine.
10	9	Never in a million years did I think this actually happened.
10	10	But there it was spinning away.
10	11	When I tried to explain to the QM why I couldn't give him a compass check, the GPS computer suddenly went dead, just simply quit.
10	12	(which is obvious because it illuminates the QM's desk).
10	13	The Officer of the Watch immediately goes up to the flying bridge to make sure there isn't anything metal affecting the compass, and calls the Captain on deck, and engineers to fix the computer.
10	14	It continued like this for the next 45 min, with everyone on the bridge on full alert thinking there was a sub tailing the ship, and sonar repeatedly showed nothing.
10	15	The captain (who is usually super professional) finally goes: "Welp, that's the weirdest fucking shit I've ever seen.
10	16	" and retreats to his cabin.
10	17	The poor QM had to plot coordinates by dead reckoning until we got to Miami.
10	18	I have plenty more spooky sea stories I can post later if people are interested.
11	0	I found a dog (pit bull) wandering in my neighborhood along a busy street.
11	1	I hopped out of my car and put my dog's spare collar on him to keep him from being hit.
11	2	I walked to all the nearby houses and knocked on the doors asking if anybody belongs to the dog or if they knew who did.
11	3	After about 10 houses I gave up and took him home.
11	4	That afternoon I made "found dog" fliers (without the dog's picture), about 100 in all and put the up around the area.
11	5	In front of my house I put a big one so people would know that this was the place.
11	6	After a few days I had pretty much resigned myself to keeping the guy when I got a phone call.
11	7	The lady gave a perfect description of the dog and I told her she could swing by and pick him up.
11	8	About an hour later she shows up, with the cops.
11	9	She gets out of her car and greets me with
11	10	"Are you the asshole that stole my dog?!?
11	11	"
11	12	I was of course taken aback.
11	13	I stood there with a slack jaw not knowing what to say.
11	14	"I asked you a question!
11	15	Did you steal my dog?!
11	16	"
11	17	"What?
11	18	NO!
11	19	I found a dog and tried to find his home!
11	20	"
11	21	"You stole him and I have witnesses!
11	22	" she then tried to get the officer to arrest me.
11	23	It only took a few moments for the officer to realize she was crazy.
11	24	"So he stole your dog, asked all your neighbors who the dog belonged to, put up signs saying he had the dog and then invited you over to take the dog back?
11	25	Either he's the worst criminal in the world or you don't understand the definition of 'stole' ma'm.
11	26	"
11	27	She then claimed I stole the dog for the reward money.
11	28	The officer said he didn't see an offer for a reward nor did I ask for one.
11	29	"But just out of curiosity, how much reward money were you going to offer?
11	30	" asked the officer
11	31	"$200!
11	32	That's what he wants, that's why he took the dog!
11	33	"
11	34	"Well, we have no evidence of him stealing the dog but it seems to me that he's earned the reward money.
11	35	"
11	36	Worst $200 I ever earned.
12	0	slightly similar story that i actually did tell here once, but i'll tell it once more.
12	1	anyways, not me, but a friend of mine is from a large family.
12	2	including himself, his family consists of his mom, dad, and all nine of their children, including him.
12	3	he has two sisters, both older, and only one living at home with them at the time of this story.
12	4	he tells me that everyone had left for the day except him, and he's in the kitchen making food, or something.
12	5	his mom comes home for something, and as she's getting ready to leave again, my friend asks her where she's going.
12	6	she says "well, we didn't know how to tell you guys, but since it's just you, i guess i can say.
12	7	i'm going to meet your sister.
12	8	" my friend is all "but (sister) *just* left" as the sister who did not live at home lived quite far away.
12	9	she then explains that when her and my friend's father were in high school, they had a kid and put her up for adoption.
12	10	this adopted daughter was getting married, and sought out her birth parents, because she wanted to meet them before she got married.
12	11	so on one hand, my friend, at like 17ish, finds out he has another sister that none of his other siblings new about.
12	12	on the *other* hand, this girl that was put up for adoption, hoping to meet her birth parents, not only finds out that her birth parents actually stayed together and got married, but she has *nine full on brothers and sisters that she didn't know about.
12	13	*
12	14	i could only imagine the look on her face when she found out.
13	0	My story will be buried and blah blah blah, but doesn't matter, it's good to get it off my chest.
13	1	So I am around 11 years old, playing with my friends in the playground outside, when I saw that my mate Chris had fallen over, It was no big deal, he suffered badly from Spina Bifida, and part of that seems to be that his legs would just suddenly give way, as if someone had just turned his legs switch to "Off".
13	2	I, being the biggest 11 year old you've ever seen in your life, just below 5 foot and around 130 lbs, went over to help him up, like I always did dozens of other times.
13	3	Cue this new cunt of a playground monitor, she was around 45, 350 lbs and could only manage to wear velcro shoes because she couldn't bend over long enough to tie laces.
13	4	She Screams "GET OFF HIM
13	5	NOW ROBERT!
13	6	" and in a sudden panic I dropped him after getting him halfway up.
13	7	He starts to cry because he wasn't expecting to be dropped, especially by me, it was obviously a shock to him too.
13	8	I too start to cry and I shout back at her "WHY DID YOU SHOUT AT ME?".
13	9	It was at this time that the Head Master came out, told me to "GO TO MY OFFICE NOW" and so I went, crying, while Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee dicked around, getting out this specialist equipment meant to lift him, in EXACTLY the same way as I did, like an under the arms mechanical hoist.
13	10	He kept crying for the entire 10 minutes he had to stay sat awkwardly on a paving slab until they lifted him, but not because he was in pain, but because nobody talked to him to calm him down.
13	11	My parents get called, we all sit down in the Head Masters office while I get called a bully, a disruptive influence, a lyer, disrespectful of teachers, and my parents get a twisted worse case scenario that if someone lifts him he could die or some such shit.
13	12	I get sent home for the week to think about what I did.
13	13	My parents thankfully believed my side of the story when I explained it to them at home, but they sided with the Head Master while we were there because "we didn't want to argue with him".
13	14	Chris kept falling, but no one dared go near him again when it happened, they just called for the teacher to bring the massive hoist again, like the dumb kid who has to wear the Dunce hat, at least 3 times every break-time.
13	15	I never really talked to Chris after that, smiled at him once in a while, and he smiled back, but never chatted ever again, I learned a year ago that he died not long after he left school from his other complications.
13	16	The other kids thought I was a monster because the school monitor discreetly told some kids "If you see Rob ever pushing anyone around again, like he pushed Chris, you run and tell me".
13	17	Spent the next 7 years as a bit of an outcast because the story would get more twisted to the point where I was meant to have beaten Chris up.
13	18	Pretty much changed my life from one thing to another, I hate myself for my selfishness, but I wish I never helped Chris, I fucking hate myself for thinking it
13	19	but I do, I lost all my other friends, no one came round to the house anymore, no one came to my 13th birthday even though I invited 20 other kids, got laughed at after the weekend it happened, got asked by everyone who was supposed to come If I had had a nice Birthday.
13	20	I just didn't bother with birthdays after that.
13	21	For my 18th I just had a chocolate cake with my parents and sister, then went out and caught a bus to the cinema, watched Spider-man on my own.
14	0	SO I was outside this fast-food place that sold hot dogs.
14	1	I saw a homeless woman with a shopping cart trying to come out of the joint.
14	2	She was struggling to open the door, so I did the gentleman thing and held the door open for her.
14	3	I don't know if that hobo was on crack or what, but she started yelling at me, telling me that she didn't need any help and told me to fuck off.
14	4	I let go of the door.
14	5	Smacked her right in the face.
15	0	Hummm not sure if this is exactly what you were talking about but its by far my biggest NOPE.
15	1	Years ago before I went to patrol I worked as a CO at the local jail.
15	2	It was common practice to strip search persons going into the main jail.
15	3	This one guy comes into the back.
15	4	He is about 6'3" and weighs about 350 lbs.
15	5	The procedure was to have them remove their underwear turn around facing away from the officer and squat and cough.
15	6	This would result in anything shoved up their butt to come out.
15	7	(There was this one story about a female and the projectile pill case that came out of her vag, but that was another story).
15	8	This guy hands me his underwear
15	9	and I swear they felt like they weighed 5 lbs.
15	10	If you have never seen fat guy underwear (tighty whities) they are quite large.
15	11	Well this specific pair of underwear was coated in pure shit.
15	12	It was like someone had covered the entire back side of his underwear with a quarter inch of shit and perfectly spread it over the underwear.
15	13	Mind you I have these shit covered underwear in my hand
15	14	and I am holding them by the band in pure revulsion.
15	15	The guy did his squat and cough.
15	16	He could have had a private jet up his ass for all I knew because I was in "please do not puke" mode.
15	17	Normally we give soiled clothes to the trustees to be washed.
15	18	I told the guy that the underwear needed to be thrown out.
15	19	NOPE!
15	20	He insisted that I give em back.
15	21	I gave them back to him and HE PUT THEM BACK ON!
15	22	Full on gag reflex kicking in overdrive now.
15	23	I just wanted him away from me.
15	24	He put on his jail coveralls and went into the back.
15	25	He could have had a pound of crack cocaine in that shit for all I know.
15	26	I did not care.
15	27	I get shivers down my spine thinking about it.
15	28	I have seen some horrid shit in my job but THAT one is the one that sticks with me.
16	0	When I was in 9th grade, a girl who was a year above and who had once been my friend began to harass me.
16	1	She'd say mean things about me whenever I was in earshot, write shit about me on her public blog and send me horrible emails.
16	2	At one point, her and her gay sidekick tried to jump me.
16	3	I remembered that she had a big crush on Al Gore and I knew that she used Xanga religiously so I tried to log into her Xanga, using Al Gore as the password.
16	4	Lo and behold, it worked.
16	5	I deleted every single entry she had written.
16	6	She had her account for like two years and when she saw what had happened, she made a long post about how heartbroken she was.
17	0	I took a dog off the street, and she changed my grandparent's lives.
17	1	About 5 years ago, I was leaving my old school and there were a few students clustered around something by the main gates.
17	2	I came to see what the deal was and there was this tiny, dirty, bedraggled puppy sitting on the pavement, twitching its hind legs and trying to eat a leaf.
17	3	It had no collar, and when I asked who owned the dog - no takers.
17	4	I tried enticing it to come to me with some chicken from my lunch, but it was having real trouble walking.
17	5	So 18-year-old Brooks picked up the dog and brought it home.
17	6	Little thing was remarkably chill about strangers, but I guess it was aware enough to recognise help when it was offered.
17	7	My mother and I fed the pup (A bitch, as it turned out) some water and tinned dog food, washed her down, and put her in a box lined with towels for the night - our own dopey mongrel came over, investigated, and tried to help clean the newcomer.
17	8	He's still very defensive of her when they meet, which is charming.
17	9	Once she was in better health, she was revealed as an energetic little mongrel fuzzball with boundless reserves of affection for her new family, and very keen ears - her watchdog abilities put our own dog to shame.
17	10	We nicknamed her "Smalldog" (I'm just the most creative person) and kept her for 6 weeks while we put up posters and photos around town, looking for the person who'd lost her.
17	11	We reasoned that such an enthusiastic, affectionate and tiny dog probably had her owners in fits looking for her.
17	12	Unfortunately, nobody came looking for her, so I rang my grandparents and had one of my all-time favourite conversations with them - They were missing having a dog around since their last fella had died, and being able to give them Smalldog was just heartwarming.
17	13	They took her home, named her Jess, and they're the happiest little household I've ever seen now.
17	14	Jess is alert enough to keep the house under constant guard, but she's small enough that she doesn't present any physical risk to my elderly grandparents.
17	15	She keeps them active by giving them a tangible reason to go for walks, and is a constant source of affection and comfort for them.
17	16	They love her and she loves them.
17	17	My favourite part of this story is this: Jess still remembers who I am.
17	18	Every time I call up to my grandparents for a visit, they tell Jess I'm coming, and Jess loses it every time.
17	19	She does laps of the garden and jumps for joy when she sees me come to call.
17	20	That little dog, and the way she makes my grandparents smile, makes me feel like a hero.
18	0	I was at a bar in Boston and noticed there was a backpack under my table.
18	1	I open it to find a new Macbook pro and a few architecture books with a Northeastern college sticker on it.
18	2	I went through the items looking for a name or some sort of way to identify the owner but found nothing.
18	3	I really didnt want to give this to the bouncer because i knew it would probably "disappear".. but after about 30 I turned it in to the bartender who put it behind the bar.
18	4	Fast forward an hour later and this girl comes through the door walks over to where i was and starts looking all around.. just keeps saying "where is my backpack" over and over..
18	5	I say Hey, i just gave it to the bartender.
18	6	Saying nothing she PUSHES my girlfriend out of the way and rushes to the bar demanding her backpack.
18	7	Bartender turns it over then she opens it to inspect the contents.
18	8	When she realizes its all there she just turns and walk out.
18	9	No thank you..
18	10	Nothing...
18	11	TL;DL i could be typing this on a new Macbook Pro
19	0	A coworker set me up with her neighbor to help him get back into the swing of things following his divorce.
19	1	When I met him at the restaurant, he was dressed kinda freaky with tall black boots, a pink button down with the collar standing up, and large hoop earrings.
19	2	I called my coworker as soon as I finished dinner and she said that he didn't sound like her neighbor.
19	3	Unfortunately it was.
19	4	He was having some sort of psychotic breakdown and ended up killing himself a short time later.
20	0	This happened when I was about five or six, and it's stayed clear in my mind since then.
20	1	Never did figure out if it was real or just a really vivid night terror.
20	2	There I was, reading my Sesame Street book, all cozy in my bunk bed with my siblings and parents fast asleep leaving me and my imagination awake to entertain ourselves.
20	3	I was a little nerdy bookworm who would read when I couldn't sleep at night (which was nearly every night), but this particular night something felt off.
20	4	As I lay there, reading with only the moonlight streaming in from my bedroom window as my flashlight, I realized how cold the room had gotten.
20	5	In an attempt to stave off the night chill, I set my book down next to me and pulled my quilts up closer to my chin.
20	6	The book slid down and fell into the crack between the wall and my bed, so instinctively I reached down to retrieve my lost treasure.
20	7	As I was pulling the book up, however, I felt a slight tug on the end of it.
20	8	Like this would keep me from my Grover!
20	9	I pulled back, IT pulled back.
20	10	I pulled again, and IT pulled back STRONGER.
20	11	A flash of a hand could be seen then even in the darkness, and my eyes grew wide.
20	12	All of a sudden, the child in me reeled with fear as the knowledge of all those terrible stories might possibly be true.
20	13	Now, would I try to get my book back or face certain death?
20	14	I'll admit, I was one risk-loving kid.
20	15	This was nothing to be fooling with, though, so I let go.
20	16	The book hit the hardwood floor with a THUD and I heard a scrapping under my bed like nails on a chalkboard.
20	17	As stiff as a board, I didn't move an inch except to dart my eyes to my sleeping sister in the bed ten feet away.
20	18	All I heard was the soft snore from the unmoving form, as well as from my dreaming younger brother above.
20	19	The next morning, thinking it had just been a figment of my lovely imagination, I go under the bed to get back my cherished possession... only to find it nowhere to be found.
20	20	All that was left was a deep scratch in the floor next to where the book should have been.
20	21	Needless to say, I read in my well-lit closet with the door shut and a mound of blankets for years after.
21	0	My mother had amassed 30,000 of debt without me knowing and on the day of receiving a surprising eviction notice, she tries to commit suicide by overdosing on opiates (think it was oxycontin/oxycodone and bunch of other shit), I phoned emergency services and essentially save her life.
21	1	Well now this debt is on me, and whilst she was being tended to my 8 month pregnant fianc and I have nowhere to live
21	2	and I just quit my job to become my mother's full time carer (she has 2 chronic conditions).
21	3	Well I Have to deal with debt, get all our possessions out of the old house, find a new one, and so on and so forth, you kinda get the idea, but yeah essentially the gist is I have absolutely no money, and because of this and only this reason my entire family now has disowned me and hates the living guts out of me just because I didn't have the money to commute to the hospital every day.
21	4	I mean seriously, If I didn't make the call I did she'd be fucking dead, and because of such an insignificant thing I got hate messages on everything, social networks, emails, phones etc.
21	5	I now only talk to my mother once a week through a text message, and before that point, since the age of 10 I have been looking after my mum's chronic conditions the entire time, It feels like shit to have devoted your entire life to one person, to have your entire family disown you and your mother to not want to talk to you anymore, she's not even grateful for me saving her life even though she's happy about being alive still, she actually hates me for it.
21	6	What the fuck did I do wrong...
22	0	A girl I took a class with told me about a meetup with a guy she met online.
22	1	She invited him to her workplace so that they'd meet in a public area with other people around.
22	2	He texted her from the parking lot and asked if she had any napkins or tissues that she could bring to him.
22	3	Apparently he felt the need to "take care of business" prior to seeing her but had no way of cleaning himself up.
22	4	She brought him some napkins and told him she never wants to see him around again.
23	0	my father in law likes to tell this story about when he was trucking in the 70s, I don't know how try it is.
23	1	He had just pulled into a truck stop for the night and was in the bunk getting ready for bed filling out his logs etc, when he hears a knock on his door.
23	2	He comes out of the bunk and there is a man looking in the window, so he rolls the window down a crack and asks him what he wants.
23	3	The man offers to watch just truck for the night for 10 dollars.
23	4	My father in law says "no, I'm not paying you to watch my truck!
23	5	Now get off my truck and leave me alone!
23	6	" The man replies "Mister, I'm not on your truck.
23	7	" He was standing flat on the ground looking in the window.
23	8	So he gave him 10 dollars just so he wouldn't do anything to the truck, expecting him to leave as soon as he got the money.
23	9	When he woke up the next morning there was the giant standing in front of the truck, arms crossed watching for anyone that might want to fuck with it.
