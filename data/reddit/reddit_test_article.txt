0	0	I am so late to this thread that this likely won't get read, but I have to share it.
0	1	I live in Southern Ontario, and sometimes we get some farkin cold weather.
0	2	One night I was leaving my mums house from a visit, and it was "colder than a witches tit" as my dad would say ... somewhere around -30, plus some wind.
0	3	It was fucking cold.
0	4	So I'm driving back to my place when I see a girl, late teens early 20s, walking down the road in an un-sensible outfit... knee length skirt, runners, sweatshirt, no hat, gloves, coat.
0	5	On a whim I pulled up beside her and said "its fucking cold, can I give you a ride somewhere ..
0	6	you shouldn't be out walking in this weather".
0	7	she smiled and said sure, hops in my car
0	8	and I start moving.
0	9	Idle conversation starts ...
0	10	where are you from, what do you do, where are you going.
0	11	Then she asks "do you like to party?
0	12	" ..
0	13	I was like "I've been to a party or two I suppose".
0	14	she said "no, i mean, do you like to go out and pickup girls and party?
0	15	" .. me, still stupid "well, I go to parties, but the picking up isn't really a strong point *laugh*".
0	16	She says "well, you can always pick up with me" and proceeds to reach her hand over and put it on my thigh, then she says "for $100 I can keep going".
0	17	I laughed and brushed her hand aside by claiming I had to shift, and said thanks
0	18	but no.
0	19	She asked if I was shy, or if I thought she didn't mean it ..
0	20	I told her maybe shy, but not interested.
0	21	Then she upped the ante ... "for $200 I'll dress up like a schoolgirl and you can fuck me in the ass"
0	22	After a quick gulp, I asked her how much further until we got where she needed to go.
0	23	It was just ahead so I pulled in ..
0	24	she climbed out of the car and said "last chance", turned around, lifted up her skirt and showed me her bare ass.
0	25	I told her to have a good night and she sighed and said ok, and closed the door.
0	26	I immediately called my mother and, laughing hard, said " I just accidently picked up a hooker!".
0	27	For years now she's been telling people that only I could try and offer someone a ride on the coldest night of the year and end up with a hooker.
0	28	And yes, I'm sure some of you would have taken her up on the offer, but that's just not my thing :)
1	0	I was at a large rock festival.
1	1	Someone was being a douche and throwing tightly filled brown paper bags with grass and dirt.
1	2	They were not deadly of course... but could still cause a bit of pain.
1	3	I saw one of these grass-bags coming for the woman in front of me.
1	4	I quickly threw both my hands in front of her face to block the projectile.
1	5	Unfortunately I greatly miscalculated the bags trajectory and it fell out of her eye sight.
1	6	She just kept telling me, very sternly 'You need to leave, You need to leave.
1	7	' She wouldn't even let me explain.
1	8	:(
2	0	This is a story about my mother told to me by my grandmother.
2	1	My mother and her family lived in rural Kansas in the 60's.
2	2	It should go without saying that there were very few black people there at the time.
2	3	Well, one day when my mom was about 4, my grandmother took her into the city to run some errands.
2	4	When they get to the city, my mom saw a pretty little black girl with braided hair and a very nice Sunday dress.
2	5	(Remember, these descriptions are from my grandmother.
2	6	)
2	7	My mother, having not ever seen a black person before, was very shocked and exciting!
2	8	She immediately tugged on my grandmother's dress yelling, "Look mommy a MONKEY!
2	9	" My grandmother immediately put her hand over my mother's mouth and left the area.
3	0	posted this the other day...
3	1	A couple of seniors of my high school were pulling into parking lot, before school, in a "beater F-150".
3	2	It was a nice Friday morning
3	3	and they had come up with this silly plan to do a drive-by mooning of some "popular girls".
3	4	( No doubt to impress)
3	5	They had done this before so they had a rehearsed plan.
3	6	As they proceeded to pull closer to the girls, the driver honks his horn as the passenger drops his pants and sticks his ass all the way out the window.
3	7	The passenger felt a nice fart welling up inside at this time, so he decided it would be extra funny to turn this into a drive-by gassing.
3	8	He executed with precision timing.
3	9	Here is where it all goes wrong.
3	10	The previous day was Senior Ditch Day and he spent much of the previous day consuming copious ammounts of alcohol, apparently passing out a number of times.
3	11	So when he "let 'er rip" it was not a bubble of gas he was releasing, so-much-as a torrent of bile and fecal matter, in the form of a geyser.
3	12	From five feet away at eye level, he had unleashed 24pk
3	13	o' shit and hosed the girls.
3	14	While the first escaped with little damage, the two other girls had taken direct hits.
3	15	Vomit, screaming and crying was produced by many spectators
4	0	This story is bizarre, but 100% true:
4	1	When I was in college I quit my full-time summer job to work for a rich, psychotic acquaintance who attended my school.
4	2	He hired me to be his personal assistant, my boyfriend to be his personal chef, and one of my friends to be his "vice president.
4	3	" He had no business, no friends, and no idea what he was doing
4	4	-
4	5	he just had a lot of money because his father was a judge.
4	6	He was a year younger than me.
4	7	We had a fridge stocked with Red Bull, Smirnoff Ice, and Poland Spring and nothing else.
4	8	My boyfriend prepared cornish game hens, lobsters, and steak for lunch every day.
4	9	I drove the guy around, did his laundry, and wrote his papers for his summer classes.
4	10	He lived in a crappy apartment, but he paid each of us $400/wk out of his personal checking account.
4	11	He'd pay us to do things like watch TV with him, play touch football, or put on candles and music and have dinner laid out before he and his dates arrived home, so it looked like he had a butler.
4	12	Once he had me go to Dick's Sporting Goods to buy him socks.
4	13	Another time I read a few chapters of Harry Potter aloud to him.
4	14	Eventually he hired a few "interns" that were first year Harvard students.
4	15	They thought they were going to be helping him make an internet business.
4	16	Instead they helped him install WoW and organized his photo albums.
4	17	He paid them $500/wk.
4	18	The summer culminated with him getting us all drunk, taking us to a tattoo parlor, and trying to pay all of us to get his initials tattooed on our bodies.
4	19	My boyfriend and I refused, but my best friend who was tagging along with me that night actually went through with it, and so did a few other people.
4	20	The following week his parents discovered what he'd been doing with his money.
4	21	By that point he had about 7 employees.
4	22	They cut him off, took him out of school, and shut down the "business.
4	23	"
4	24	I made about $5,000 that summer and returned to school in the fall like nothing had happened.
5	0	Okay, here's my story.
5	1	When I was a kid I thought The Notar Republic was an island in the Caribbean, just like The Dominican Republic.
5	2	When people said they were going to see the Notar Republic I just figured they were going on vacation.
5	3	It took until I was 20 to realize that to get something notarized did not mean getting your passport stamped in the Notar Republic, but rather just seeing some dude called a notary public.
6	0	2 years ago, I tried to kill myself.
6	1	I got up, showered, got dressed, put on my favorite perfume and tried to jump from the GWB.
6	2	On my way there, this man stops me, tells me I look like his wife who passed away.
6	3	Says I was just as beautiful and that she died on a day like this.
6	4	The light is still green, I cant cross, he is still talking.
6	5	He stops and tells me that whatever is going on i n my life that it will pass and that my life was precious.
6	6	I start crying and run home.
6	7	That old man saved my life.
7	0	I found a purse in a grocery basket once.
7	1	I went across the street, got myself an ice cream cone, found the driver's license, looked her up in the phone book, and called.
7	2	She accused me of stealing it and started saying she was calling the police.
7	3	She threatened me with police reports and litigation.
7	4	I told her "OK, your purse will be sitting in the parking lot then, better hope someone less honest than me doesn't find it before you do".
7	5	I drove back across the street, tossed the purse in the parking lot, and drove home.
8	0	Okay so even though this isn't supernatural or "creepy" or anything it was fucking scary!
8	1	I live in Sydney, AUS and this was probably just over a year ago.
8	2	I was driving with my girlfriend back to my home after going out to dinner at her friends house in Bondi, which is about 15 minutes away from my area called Watsons Bay.
8	3	To get back to my place you need to drive down into the valley near the harbour down a long winding main road that progressively takes you down to the water.
8	4	It was around 1:30 or 2am
8	5	and we were making our way down the road not really paying attention to much, and she suddenly grabs my arm and gasps (which freaked me out already).
8	6	As i'm looking around as to what the fuck is going on, we approach the roundabout and there is a man in medical looking attire next to a woman in what looked like white pyjamas, with blood covering a lot of her clothing.
8	7	Now obviously my balls drop and instinct kicks in as i speed up, it's quite a small roundabout
8	8	so i need to either slow down enough to turn left, or speed up and nope the fuck straight out of there.
8	9	I go straight, and as we go past the woman attempts to launch herself at my car as the man looked like he was trying to stop her.
8	10	I speed off, we get home about 3 or 4 minutes later and we're both shaken and basically scared shitless.
8	11	Called the police to inform them of what we just saw, and got a call back the next afternoon explaining how a woman had somehow run away from a mental home and was attempting to commit suicide using sharp objects and running onto main roads.
8	12	The man was one of the first workers who knew her on the scene and apparently they managed to bring her back to where she lived, heard nothing more after that.
9	0	I heard this one from a stand-up comic guy (can't remember his name), but it's one of those "what in the fucking fuck" stories.
9	1	And it's true from what I heard.
9	2	I know I couldn't make up something like this.
9	3	So this guy was an EMT and had a 911 call about a woman about to give birth, but she didn't have anyone to take her to the hospital.
9	4	So the ambulance showed up, and the EMT actually had to partially put his hand inside of the woman's vagina to keep the baby's head from laying wrong and getting complications.
9	5	When they got to the hospital, the doctors realized they had to perform an emergency c-section on the mother.
9	6	The whole time, the EMT has not taken his hand out of the mother's vagina.
9	7	So the doctor performs the c-section and the baby comes out of her stomach, and then the doctor REACHES INSIDE THE MOTHER and shakes the EMT's hand while still inside her vagina for a job well done.
9	8	That's fucking fantastic if you ask me.
10	0	There was a known, violent mentally-ill person named "Chop" in a neighborhood I worked in.
10	1	As a rookie, I got a call of a prowler cutting through someone's yard near a cemetery.
10	2	Its very dark and foggy.
10	3	I pulled up to the area, spoke with the caller and she described Chop.
10	4	Chop was known to sleep in the cemetery and wander about during the night.
10	5	If left alone, he usually just went on his way.
10	6	Well, being a rookie, I had to find this guy and see if he needed help/was a danger to the public, etc.
10	7	I'm shining lights all around and I finally see Chop standing next to fence, with a hole in it, leading into the cemetery.
10	8	Chop is huge, both in height and breadth.
10	9	I call for an additional unit, only to be told that backup was a way's off.
10	10	I exit the car, staying close to it and notice Chop has a 40 ounce bottle in one hand and a boxcutter in the other.
10	11	I think to myself, whelp, if he attacks me, I'll probably have to shoot him.
10	12	I announce myself and Chop beings just screaming, starting at me with the rage of psychotic.
10	13	He then makes a fist and shatters the bottle he was HOLDING IN HIS HAND.
10	14	He then proceeds to start muttering and go through the hole in the fence, into the cemetery.
10	15	Got back in the car and pulled back in service.
11	0	One time I was at a fancy brunch at a hotel in Washington D.C.
11	1	I went to the ladies room.
11	2	Inside there was a woman standing with her skirt thrown over her head while she worked on hiking her pantyhose up.
11	3	I hate pantyhose for this reason - so I said, "Oh geez, don't you hate it when hose creep down.
11	4	" I heard a muffled laugh as I went into the stall to deal with my own needs.
11	5	When I walked out the woman was refreshing her lipstick.
11	6	I saw her face, then noticed her broach.
11	7	I had just had a girlfriend moment with the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright.
11	8	There were two large men in suits standing outside the restroom, who I didn't notice on my way in.
11	9	They escorted her back into the brunch.
12	0	I was in first grade at my friends birthday party.
12	1	It was at a mini-golf place.
12	2	Being only 6 years old, Id never done any kind of golfing before, so I only knew what Id always seen in movies or on TV: guys swinging it back and forth a few times before bringing it way back and up and then whacking the eff out of the ball.
12	3	Nevermind that a few kids went before me and I watched them hit.
12	4	Thats how I thought it was done.
12	5	So, it gets to be my turn.
12	6	The birthday boys older sister (maybe 13; also my babysitter) was standing pretty close behind me.
12	7	Guess what I did?
12	8	I whacked the *shit* out of her face.
12	9	She screamed, her nose bled everywhere and I think I may have broken it.
12	10	I immediately started bawling and I think some adult yanked the club out of my hands.
12	11	I will never get over that embarrassment, but in retrospect, chick shouldnt have been standing so close.
13	0	When my cousin and I were little, her parents were going to be out of town for the day so she asked if I wanted to come over and hang out.
13	1	We got bored and decided we were going to put up a lemonade stand.
13	2	Only one problem - we couldn't find the sugar.
13	3	She called her mom and told her it was on the counter.
13	4	We found it but it was only really enough for one pitcher, so I rode my bike down to the store to grab some more.
13	5	She makes the first pitcher with the stuff on the counter.
13	6	Says it's bubbling as she mixes it
13	7	but I say it's probably the air in the pipes making those bubbles.
13	8	Get back, start setting up the stand and we get our first customer - the ice cream truck guy!
13	9	Awesome.
13	10	We give him his drink and he takes a sip.
13	11	Instantly makes a face and tells us we must have used salt instead of sugar - it was nasty.
13	12	He leaves and we just assume he's a weird dude.
13	13	Keep on going.
13	14	Some kids from down the street set up another lemonade stand and stop over.
13	15	We had a few different favors so they buy a couple drinks from us and start drinking.
13	16	The kid says that the one kind is nasty but it's good when mixed with another one we had (one that was made with the sugar I bought).
13	17	He finishes his drink and leaves.
13	18	At the end of the day her parents are on their way home so we start packing up and heading inside.
13	19	Her mom enters the kitchen and asks us why we didn't do our lemonade stand.
13	20	We said we did.
13	21	She says well where did you get the sugar from and picks up a package of sealed sugar off the counter.
13	22	We are confused.
13	23	She told her we used the stuff of the counter like she said - the sugar that was in the plastic baggie.
13	24	She starts laughing at us and says that was laundry detergent.
14	0	i'm jewish but my boyfriend isn't.
14	1	we were staying at my jewish friend's house when bf &amp; i decided to order a pizza.
14	2	half cheese (me), half pepperoni (him).
14	3	i don't eat pig but i don't care if my boyfriend does.
14	4	it arrives, we're eating when i realize - holy shit, i brought unkosher food into my kosher friend's house!
14	5	at this point i start freaking out, since this is the 2nd time i have accidentally brought unkosher food into her house.
14	6	my bf tells me it's NBD, don't tell her, it won't hurt her.
14	7	being the honest person that i am, i decide to ignore his advice and tell her anyway.
14	8	i calm myself down, call her, tell her what happened and sincerely apologize for the mistake.
14	9	she goes off on me, "i can't believe that you did this *again*, now i have to clean the entire house from top to bottom, etc etc... if you honestly apologize for it and feel bad, i'll forgive you.
14	10	" so, i tell her again i honestly felt bad and my apology was sincere...
14	11	nope, she's not buying it, we are no longer friends.
15	0	Okay, so I'm a tiny white girl.
15	1	It was around ten o'clock at night and I decided I wanted ice cream.
15	2	I go outside and walk down my drive way to the corner store.
15	3	At the same time I noticed I had forgotten my wallet, I make eye contact with two young black men walking in the middle of the street.
15	4	I make a really startled face because I don't have my money and I try to run back inside my house to grab it, but instead I fall, making me look even more scared of their presence.
15	5	By now I'm really embarrassed and so when they call out to ask if I'm okay I just look at them wide-eyed and dart into my house.
15	6	They turned out to be my new neighbors.
15	7	Yay!
16	0	I was visiting a friend in Chicago and he decided to take me out for authentic mexican food the night before I left.
16	1	The morning rolls around for me to leave and it's a weekday morning.
16	2	Which means busy as fuck traffic on the Dan Ryan.
16	3	About 15 minutes into my drive deadlocked in Chi town morning traffic my stomachs starts burgling.
16	4	Apparently spicy carnitas are like liquid drano to my bowls.
16	5	At this point I know I'm gonna have to shit soon.
16	6	Fighting my way off that bastard of a highway to the first off ramp I can see.
16	7	I feel it coming so I have to clench my cheeks together like a vise while cutting motherfuckers off like a boss.
16	8	Pretty soon I'm clenching so hard I'm fucking planking face up in my car while driving.
16	9	I finally make it off the highway and all I see is a Home Depot and a movie theatre close to each other.
16	10	By this time I'm sweating and not giving a fuck about anybody who is in my way.
16	11	I pull into a parking space and start my sprint into HD with stomach at a level 4 meltdown and then it happens.....
16	12	Me a grown fucking man......
16	13	SHIT MYSELF.
16	14	At this point I couldn't go into HD I had shit running down my pants legs into my shoes and I smelled like carnita death.
16	15	Only thing I could do was get back into my car and drive around to figure out what to do.
16	16	I went behind the movie theater and found that no one was back there.
16	17	Got out my shitmobile and finished releasing carnita death on the snow with just a t-shirt and shoes on.
16	18	I grabbed another old t shirt from my bag and cleaned my self up with that.
16	19	Changed into some clean clothes OUTSIDE, left my clothes and hopped back into the shitmobile.
16	20	The smell was horrid in my car, no shit got on my seat but the smell was stuck in my car.
16	21	(like the scent from Seinfeld).
16	22	I hopped back on the expressway and drove to a TA station where I could clean up proper with soap and change my clothes again and buy air fresheners.
17	0	I was on a bus at the back with my headphones in when a couple gets on and sits just about in the middle, this is 5pm so the bus is very busy.
17	1	Anyways I don't know what was said but this bloke jumps up and starts throwing haymakers at this woman and kicking at her, everyone else on the bus just put their head down
17	2	but I was all "Man fuck this shit" so I jumped up ran along the bus and clocked him square in the jaw.
17	3	Anyways the mother fucker dropped like a sack of potatoes, just as I'm turning to ask if this woman is ok she starts clawing at my face drawing blood, so at this point I'm faced with a dilemma I can't hit a bird but bitch is crazy.
17	4	So at this point I notice she has shopping with her, so I grab a loaf of bread and start beating the bitch round the head with a loaf of Hovis
18	0	We went out to dinner, didn't feel much of anything there.
18	1	He seemed nice enough but I just wasn't interested.
18	2	He drove me to my apartment and I said "thank you for dinner (even though I paid for mine), goodnight" basically and he said no, no lets watch TV.
18	3	I said okay even though I didn't want him coming in..
18	4	I don't like to make people feel bad.
18	5	Long story short he ended up trying to have sex with me, when I told him no, I don't know you, not happening REPEATEDLY.
18	6	He continued to grab me and try to convince me.
18	7	Frustrated, he took his dick out and started jacking off.. kept grabbing my hands trying to get me to do it.. kept touching me and trying to take my pants off.
18	8	This only lasted about a minute or two before he came saying my name.
18	9	I was so disgusted.
18	10	I didn't go off on him because he was a 40 year old six foot body builder that could easily take me, a 22 year old, five foot ten girl.
18	11	I live alone and I just wanted him to leave
18	12	so I was nice.
18	13	He thought things went well and texted me for weeks after with no response from me.
18	14	I cancelled my account the next day.
19	0	I met a female on Plenty of Fish and we dated for a year.
19	1	I broke up with her when she posted some personal things on FB.
19	2	She later broke into my house, and among other things, put what i believe was a caustic cleaning product into a bottle of vodka and a bottle of personal lubricant.
19	3	Oh, and she trashed my laptop.
19	4	She lied and told the cops that she lived there and was trying to get her things.
20	0	Vandal and arson: The neighbor down the street from us, killed my dachshund.
20	1	She was a little older than a puppy and very sweet.
20	2	One night she tunneled out from our back yard and I had to run after her.
20	3	I thought she was in some bushes but I was wrong.
20	4	I was hidden behind these bushes when I saw my neighbor's mini van run her down.
20	5	They backed up, hit her again, backed up, and ran her over once more before they left.
20	6	For some reason I didn't feel like telling my parents that because it's a bad story.
20	7	It was better to just say she didn't suffer and that it was quick.
20	8	In the meantime I was breaking their sprinkler system and I sprinkled weed killer on their yard so the grass and flowers turned brown.
20	9	They had four cars and I broke all their windows and stole all their radios.
20	10	I had no idea how to steal radios so it turned out horrible, I ruined their wood paneling.
20	11	The car alarms went off but no one came out.
20	12	I carefully stuck nails into their yard by the ladder, by the recycling bin, and by the sprinkler timer so there would be a greater chance of one of them stepping onto the nails.
20	13	They installed cameras by the house so I didn't want to risk going inside.
20	14	When they installed the new glass windows, I broke them again and set fire to the inside.
20	15	It didn't feel like anything..it was boring.
20	16	I should've left her body on their pillow to remind them of what they did.
20	17	I should've taken their miniature poodles and dropped them off at the human society several towns over.
20	18	I should've taken a knife to all their furniture and left picture of dead dogs in every room of that house.
20	19	I should have poured animal blood in all their bedrooms and filled all their orange juice/milk with blood.
20	20	But that requires energy I don't have.
21	0	A guy who was stalking me and my girlfriend found 2 of my throwaways.
21	1	They were both lucky guesses -- one only mentioned my general location in a comment, and the other didn't having anything that identified me other than behavior patterns -- but it was pretty damn creepy.
21	2	Since then I have made sure to include lies in my comments as well as changing my writing style.
21	3	(This guy is incompetent with women but has a complex where he thinks they owe him attention.
21	4	He stalks them out of interest at first, and then when they freak out and reject him hard, he stalks them to harass them.
21	5	Serious mental issues there.
21	6	)
22	0	This isn't exactly creepy, but it's one of the scariest things that's ever happened to me.
22	1	I was driving down the motorway with my boyfriend in the passenger seat, and my dad in the seat behind my own.
22	2	My dad is an epileptic and his fits are extremely sporadic.
22	3	Sometimes he goes extremely stiff and other times he will try to get out of places or grab and punch people.
22	4	Mid-conversation I felt his hands wrap around my throat as I was driving, pulling my head back and making it increasingly difficult to drive.
22	5	My boyfriend managed to help steer the car into the hard shoulder but it was one of the scariest experiences in my life.
23	0	I ran a 500+ member clan and pretended to be a 27 year old north korean for like 5 years.
23	1	I knew where I lived and I was careful not to talk to real koreans ^^
23	2	I was the son of an officer.
23	3	I even did a fake accent over skype chat.
23	4	People believed me.
23	5	Then I got grounded when I was 14 and randomly explained to everyone.
23	6	Some people were like wtf and left, others were like holy crap you're an amazing liar.
23	7	Not as epic as SixofSwords, but it was pretty intense.
23	8	I was internet dating a 24 year old canadian too, she thought I was so smart and cool
23	9	but I was 12 :D ^^;
24	0	Same story basically.
24	1	I tried it once while on alcohol and the alcohol allowed me to enjoy it more.
24	2	Without alcohol, I got really nervous and felt like I was somehow psychotic.
24	3	Heart racing as well.
24	4	Even when I thought I was calm, my heart would just keep on pounding.
25	0	Lady at work said she lost a wallet.
25	1	I found it and called her.
25	2	She was super excited until she asked if money was in it.
25	3	I told her no, because it wasn't there.
25	4	She instantly became suspicious and blamed the houseman who found it.
25	5	I had to stand up for a great guy and explain to her it was her fault for losing it in the first place and that he wouldn't do that.
25	6	She then blamed me.
25	7	Finally I just let it go and hung up on her.
25	8	Mailed it back and just washed me hands of the situation.
25	9	Stinks she lost her money, but I think its worse when you automatically accuse the employee.
25	10	Especially when you don't know the circumstance.
26	0	So about a year ago i was in Iguazu Falls, Argentina.
26	1	Its a really beautiful place and to see the falls you have to walk for a mile over the water on a wooden walkway about four feet wide and packed with tourists.
26	2	To my eternal dismay after walking the mile out to the falls i feel an all to familiar pressure building in my bum.
26	3	I've got to shit.
26	4	Not in a couple minutes, right fucking now, it felt like a cherry bomb had gone off in my lower intestines.
26	5	Im start to panic, it took me a full twenty minutes to get out here and i dont think im gonna make it back.
26	6	So i take off running.
26	7	Im zigging and zagging, knocking into tourists on this narrow little walk way.
26	8	No less that three times did i stop when the intestinal pressure grew to great and prepare myself for undying shame only to have my bowels blurp and rearrange themselves.
26	9	So after ten minutes of this i've made it back to dry land and restrooms.
26	10	Im not fucking around at this point, im about to explode.
26	11	I sprint the last thirty yards and thank god im a man because the line for the womens restroom is backed out the door.
26	12	I slip into a stall, drop my droors and engage in the most satisfyingly glorious shit of my life.
26	13	And of course, being the person that i am i took a pic to show off to all my friends.
26	14	Keep in mind what your about to see was explosivly evacuated in two seconds flat.
26	15	I give you my [shit](http://i.imgur.com/WZv6q.jpg) of shits.
27	0	Shortly after my wife had our first baby (when I was exhausted and high on life all at once), a nurse came in to our room to do a hearing test on the baby.
27	1	She was filling out a form and through a thick accent asked "How many aunts with Shannon" (Shannon being my last name).
27	2	I thought for a minute and counted the number of aunts I had...."3 aunts with the last name Shannon, but I have 4 aunts total.
27	3	" My wife tried to get my attention but I brushed her off as she was still hopped up on the epidural.
27	4	Then it suddenly dawned on me that obviously she didn't want the number of *my* aunts with that last name, but rather the number of aunts my *baby* had with that name.
27	5	"Oh sorry...I mean two.
27	6	" Oh wait, that's counting my sister-in-law with a different last name.
27	7	"Sorry, I mean one.
27	8	One aunt with Shannon.
27	9	" But wait, my brother is engaged so there will be another one in just a month.
27	10	"Okay, sorry, it's one but in about a month it will be two.
27	11	"
27	12	After about 3 or 4 minutes of me babbling on like this, my wife finally succeeded in getting my attention and said, "All she wanted to know is how many letter 'N's are in your last name.
27	13	" [Whoops.
27	14	](http://i.imgur.com/dicV8LG.png)
28	0	I attended the wedding of a family friend's daughter, so didn't really know her.
28	1	It was a nighttime reception, so probably from 6pm-11 or 12, the ceremony immediately preceding.
28	2	When we went into the reception, we were expecting a buffet or something to be set up, but there was nothing.
28	3	Later we found out that there was no food for the 120 guests, but rather a cheese spread, fruit platter, and vegetables with dip.
28	4	After an hour, people were really hungry and some people started to leave because they were expecting to be fed and didn't want to stay.
28	5	When the bride found out, she ran across the room in her dress and blocked the doors, screaming about how everyone is ruining her wedding and screaming "Bride's Day, Bride's Way!
28	6	" It was such a scene that her father had to peel her off the door (don't know where the husband was, probably cowering) and people who didn't know her that well all left.
28	7	I heard through the grapevine that she was inconsolable the entire night, got trashed and threw up (hopefully on her dress, but not sure).
28	8	Oh well, Bride's Day, Bride's Way!
29	0	One fateful day during library time in the 2nd grade I farted.
29	1	The librarian was reading us a book.
29	2	It just came out of nowhere, short and sweet.
29	3	And loud.
29	4	Everyone heard.
29	5	And they all looked bafflingly towards my general direction, but they hadn't yet zeroed in on my location.
29	6	So without missing a beat, I put on my shocked face and looked at the kid next to me.
29	7	Everyone thought it was him.
29	8	He kept denying it, saying it was me, but everyone believed me.
29	9	I'm in college now, and I've lost touch with this kid.
29	10	I just friended him on facebook with the intention of posting an apology on his wall.
30	0	I used to work at a place that sold used car batteries in a predominately black neighborhood.
30	1	We used to mark these batteries with white stickers that read "Econo Power" to mark with date codes for warranty purposes.
30	2	Cue an older black gentleman walks in wanting to discuss his warranty and that his battery is bad.
30	3	There is no sticker
30	4	so I say to him, "We can only warranty batteries the the 'White Power' label on them.
30	5	" He gets rather wide eyed and asks me "What kind of sticker" to which I reply again, "White powe.....
30	6	Oh, Ummm one second.
30	7	" I head to the back laughing hysterically and make a co worker go finish taking care of him.
30	8	He finishes his business, gets a new battery and tells the co worker he'd like to see me before he goes, I walk up still giggling like an idiot and he says to me "White Power my ni**a" And we shook hands and had a laugh about it.
31	0	I was at a Slipknot concert.
31	1	It was raining earlier so the grass is really soft and people start throwing chunks of dirt at other people across the venue.
31	2	There is a woman standing next to me when a huge piece of dirt comes flying straight at her face.
31	3	I grab the chunk inches from her face mid-air.
31	4	The security sees me with a chunk of dirt in my hand and instantly grab and pull me out of the crowd.
31	5	Luckily her boyfriend cleared everything up with security.
32	0	In high school, I never studied except maybe the night before exams.
32	1	I was taking a college physics class that was pretty difficult, but our teacher never cared what we did during class, treating us more like college students.
32	2	Doing work was on you.
32	3	One day I walked into class ready to play a game, work on other class work, or just chat with my friends like I did every day.
32	4	I look around and everyone is spread out.
32	5	My teacher exclaims "Alright everyone, get out your calculators and a pencil.
32	6	Exam day.
32	7	" I had no bleeping idea there was an exam and I wasn't even sure what it was over.
32	8	Instead of trying to think of a way out, I knew I was screwed.
32	9	His exams were difficult, there was nothing I could do.
32	10	I took a seat, got a pencil and simply thought I would write expressions and equations down and hope for a 40/100 or something.
32	11	I was so sure I wasn't going to do anything that day, I didn't even bring my calculator to school.
32	12	Sitting there hopeless and staring at my thermodynamics exam, my professor came up to me and gave me his calculator to use since I forgot mine.
32	13	"What a nice guy," I thought.
32	14	"He has no clue how screwed I am.
32	15	"
32	16	I began the exam simply trying to guess at the math, punching in variables from the problems.
32	17	There were 6 pages, each page had one big physics problem.
32	18	After writing BS on each page, I actually legitimately tried to do the last problem.
32	19	I messed up punching a number in the calculator, so I went back in the calculator memory to retrieve a previous number.
32	20	I accidentally went back too far and saw values that the teacher must have punched in when he last used it, since it was his calculator.
32	21	However, I noticed that the number that my teacher put in matched a number in the last problem on the test.
32	22	I hit it again, another familiar value came up.
32	23	I realized just then that my teacher had just taken the entire exam himself so he could gage how long to give his students.
32	24	Using the calculator that MY TEACHER gave me, I worked the entire test backward using the memory of the calculator.
32	25	I got a 94%, missing one point on each page because I never listed the units in my answer (because I had no idea), and I set the curve.
33	0	I always turn up late for those what secret do you know threads so here goes **YOU ARE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR YOUR ENERGY*
33	1	* Shocking isn't it.
33	2	no?
33	3	you already know your being over charged?
33	4	take your gas/electric bill divide it by 10 and you'd still be being ripped off a little.
33	5	I used to work for a UK energy company and through asking the right people the right questions I learned about the distribution gap.
33	6	You know those companies who take your money and provide you gas and electricity like E.on and British gas.
33	7	their knows as energy distributer.
33	8	They buy energy from 'energy generators' and sell it to you the customer.
33	9	over the past few years energy distributor's have been telling us the alarming price hikes in our energy bills have been due to rising fuel prices.
33	10	They have to pay more money for energy we have to pay them more money.
33	11	Eon has even been running at a slight loss.
33	12	heres the kicker.
33	13	nearly every energy distributer in the UK has an energy generator owned by the same parent company thereby guaranteeing no one ever questions these companies profit margins.
33	14	They essential charge them selves what ever profit they want to make then inform us of the bad news.
34	0	In my early twenties I rented an apartment in the same apartment complex as some friends I'd known for about a month.
34	1	About three months into their lease they informed me they were behind in their rent.
34	2	Though I couldn't really afford it, and knew I'd never see the money again, I went ahead and cut them a check for $300 dollars so they wouldn't have to default.
34	3	They later began stealing car stereos in the complex, taking my car without permission, and eventually breaking the door down in my apartment because they claimed they had left some of their belongings inside.
34	4	Because the complex was shady and wouldn't fix the door I moved the frick out of there before someone broke in and murdered me.
34	5	Upon coming back to clean up and get the last of my belongings (when the lease eventually ran out) I was told the cops swung by because my friends had come back and began squatting in my vacant apartment after defaulting on theirs.
34	6	And finally, in a final act of "Let's-slap-zeescarlet-in-the-face," the person I loaned the money to got up in my face and started screaming he was going to kill me when I expressed distress over having my car taken without my permission yet again.
34	7	Looking back on it, he might have been on drugs.
35	0	When I was 15 and working at a summer camp, I was asked to remove a bench from the lake shore.
35	1	*Alone*.
35	2	It turned out to have two concrete blocks on the bottom.
35	3	I managed to saw off the bottoms of the les and get the blocks into a wheelbarrow.
35	4	I wheeled it to a dumpster, but that was the easy part.
35	5	I then had to lift both of these easily 200 pound blocks about 4 feet up to reach the side window of the dumpster.
35	6	I got the first one in just fine, the second one was heavier so I rested it on the ledge for a moment.
35	7	Unfortunately it slipped and fell in, so I though no problem, job done.
35	8	It wasn't until 30 seconds later that I looked down and noticed blood **POURING** out of my ring finger.
35	9	It turned out that the concrete that slipped had caught my finger against the edge of the dumpster and quite literally smashed it off at the first knuckle.
35	10	I walked into the first aid station and said "I think I need some first aid".
35	11	Never had I seen the blood drain from someone's face quite that fast.
35	12	They called the EMT that worked there down from the main building and he decided to tourniquet my finger seeing as it was already amputated and I had lost a lot of blood.
35	13	It really hadn't hurt up until that point, but God DAMN did that hurt.
35	14	He then poured some iodine on a gauze pad and applied it to my finger.
35	15	My boss was kind enough to drive me to the hospital in his own car rather than wait for my parents.
35	16	So we're in the car, as he glances over at my finger.
35	17	"Powerharousegui?
35	18	" He says.
35	19	"Where is the rest of your finger?
35	20	"
35	21	15 year old me in shock responds "Must be in the dumpster..."
35	22	"Shit.
35	23	"
35	24	He called his second in command who dove into the dumpster and found it lying adjacent to the second block.
35	25	At this point it had been detached for nearly half an hour with no ice.
35	26	He sped like a demon and got to the hospital only 2 minutes after we did, even though we left about ten minutes before him.
35	27	38 stitches later, my finger was reattached at the tip and they gave me a Percocet prescription and told me not to play the guitar for a couple weeks.
35	28	That was the worst part of the whole ordeal.
35	29	I have pictures of it, I'll have to do some digging to find them though.
36	0	Similar story.
36	1	My mom found a phone in the middle of a car park near an Ikea.
36	2	It was low on battery (it was dead by the point she brought it home), so she picked it up and brought it home because she doesn't speak English that well.
36	3	She gets it home, we plug it in to charge and try to find a contact that would allow us to find the owner and return it to him.
36	4	Before we're able to go to find a contact that is similar to "Mom", "Dad" or something similar, it starts ringing.
36	5	I answer and the person on the other end says... something.
36	6	I couldn't understand him at all.
36	7	If you've played GTAIV, he sounded exactly like the guy that crashed with Little Jacob.
36	8	I tried to explain to him that we found the phone near an Ikea, but he just started sounding more and more angry.
36	9	He just hung up, leaving me confused.
36	10	Then the phone rang again.
36	11	This time, it was a woman's voice.
36	12	She said she was the owner's sister.
36	13	I explained the situation to her, while she was trying to accuse me of stealing it.
36	14	It was late at night so arranging a pickup wasn't really possible.
36	15	We finally got to an agreement that we'll arrange the pickup for the next day.
36	16	The next morning comes (it's a Saturday) and the phone's ringing again, even though it's really early.
36	17	I pick up and tell her the area we live in so she can pick it up.
36	18	She says she'll be on her way.
36	19	She then calls multiple times asking me to come somewhere closer to where she currently is, which is inconvenient as fuck for me, as I wasn't able to drive or get around town without paying for bus/train tickets, so I tell her I can't do that.
36	20	This is repeated a few times, with her sounding slightly angrier each time.
36	21	She finally gets to the place we've first arranged, it's 3pm.
36	22	She gets out of the car, grabs the phone, barks an angry "thanks" and gets back in the car and drives off.
36	23	It wasn't as much of being punished for my help, but the stress, inconvenience and the amount of time that I had to spend to help someone get their phone back.
36	24	I mean, I could have just thrown the SIM card out and sold it off (it was a shitty Nokia phone, but still), so the least she could do was to not be angry at me, especially when I just tried to help.
37	0	About a month or so ago, I got a random thought.
37	1	*Why hasn't the KKK been approached to endorse a bleach product yet?
37	2	*
37	3	Most people don't like the KKK, me included, but you'd use a KKK bleach.
37	4	Why?
37	5	Because that shit would work.
37	6	If anyone is going to have the absolute whitest whites, it's them.
37	7	White sheets have got to be a job requirement for those people.
37	8	They're nazis about that stuff... and most other things.
37	9	I went to google and actually found their website and sent an email asking what the official bleach of the KKK was.
37	10	I never got a response :(
38	0	I knew a woman who was a bridesmaid in a relatives wedding.
38	1	She was married and had been trying to get pregnant for a while.
38	2	Finally, her and her hubby got lucky and she conceived.
38	3	The bridezilla got furious and kicked her out of the wedding because she would be pregant in the pictures.
38	4	3 months later, sadly, the woman miscarried.
38	5	The bride called her with a response along the lines of "good, well now you can be back in the wedding.
38	6	"
38	7	Needless to say, she did nto even attend it.
39	0	I've seen a couple of weird lights occasionally, and I have no recollection of being abducted,
39	1	BUT...
39	2	When I was 12 or so, I felt something hard and round in my earlobe.
39	3	I told everyone and they said it was just an under-the-skin zit, pretty normal for someone my age.
39	4	But it was there for SIX MONTHS.
39	5	Annoyed, I decided to do some self surgery.
39	6	I could feel it very near the surface and poked a hole in my ear with a sterilized needle.
39	7	Blood, fucking everywhere, I could feel this thing and I squeezed up, towards the hole I just pierced.
39	8	Out pops this tiny metal... ball.
39	9	Maybe half the size of a BB.
39	10	It was black metal, completely spherical, with an indentation around the center, and teeny tiny golf ball-like indentations.
39	11	As I was rolling it around in my blood-covered pictures, it slipped, spun around the sink a couple of times and fell down the drain.
39	12	At 12, I had no idea what the fuck to do with it and my parents didn't believe a word I said and told me to just put some tea tree oil on my zits next time...
39	13	I have never had anything like it since.
40	0	During the winter I was a part time ski instructor.
40	1	I didn't have a lesson so another instructor asked me to calm down a crying kid in his group.
40	2	I asked the kid's name and he said, "Nichols, but you can call me Nick.
40	3	" I replied with what I thought was a rational response.
40	4	"Okay Nick, what's wrong?
40	5	"
40	6	The kid wails/cries at the top of his lungs,"why does everybody call me Nick!?
40	7	"
40	8	I didn't have anything to say to that.
41	0	My trainee and I were sent to a suicide call.
41	1	We get there, and this poor lady is screaming about her son, begging us for help between sobs.
41	2	We ran into the house, and the guy is lying somewhat peacefully on his bed with an empty prescription bottle beside him.
41	3	Prescribed two days ago, 50 pills, all gone...
41	4	yep, he's dead.
41	5	Apparently the guy had some health issues, and decided to check out by downing the entire bottle of pills.
41	6	Mom finds him hours later, and rigor had already set in by the time we get there.
41	7	As I am inspecting the scene and trying to be delicate as I'm teaching my trainee, the Mom insists on hovering right over her son, telling me to do whatever I have to.
41	8	Well, part of the job is to check all dead bodies for signs of foul play...by now my partner has arrived, and I instruct my trainee to help my partner roll the guy over to check for other wounds or anything suspicious.
41	9	Now, Mom is standing beside the bed, my partner and my trainee are trying to roll a very stiff...stiff...and I'm standing by the foot of the bed.
41	10	As the body rolls, the dead guy farts.
41	11	LOUDLY.
41	12	Epic fart really.
41	13	Before I could say anything, I learned what farts from a dead body smell like.
41	14	Let me preface this by saying I have smelled horrible things in my career: disgusting houses, gross people, gross people covered in poo, other, deader people....NOTHING compared to the dead guy fart.
41	15	I gagged and very nearly threw up on the bed, and ran out of the house.
41	16	I refused to go in, as every time I got near the door I started gagging.
41	17	The worst part was I found it funny afterwards, and the poor mom was just walking around covering her face with a tissue she was simultaneously trying to wipe her eyes with and breathe through.
41	18	I NOPE'd that, and made my partner and trainee handle the gassy guy.
42	0	Gave a beggar kid my own coffee and some biscuits in my pocket since it's illegal to give actual money to the poor.
42	1	In my country, they could be a part of a bigger gang using them for financial gains.
42	2	Since he looked hungry, I have my food (WHICH I HAVE JUST BOUGHT) and I gave it to him.
42	3	Bastard threw it rudely on the ground and said "Is this the best you can do?
42	4	Don't you have money".
42	5	I was open-mouthed, amazed.
43	0	There's a bar at the end of my street, and my mom liked to go there to watch people play pool.
43	1	She didn't drink, she would just sit there and watch and drink Diet Coke.
43	2	Apparently, she struck up a conversation with one of the guys one day, and he kissed her on the cheek and then played a great game of pool.
43	3	So after that, he'd kiss her on the cheek before he played pool.
43	4	For some reason, the guy who ran the bar accused my mom of being a prostitute and banned her from the bar.
43	5	Mind you, my mom was a sweet, 300lb 50 year old lady who worked as an engineer and dressed like she was going to work.
43	6	There was nothing about her that would make you think "prostitute".
43	7	I got revenge there several times.
43	8	My go-to was making big pizza orders and then never going to pick them up.
43	9	One time, my friends and I went to that bar, and my friend whipped his dick out and pissed all over their bar and floor.
43	10	On a Friday night with the place nearly packed.
43	11	My favorite though was this one Saturday night...on Saturdays, they had biker night, the place was packed, and they always had the jukebox blaring.
43	12	I put a $10 bill in the jukebox and played NSync's "I Want It That Way" 40 times in a row.
43	13	When I was in college, I was on a road trip and I saw a Canadian bar chain with the same name and logo.
43	14	I looked it up when I got home, and sure enough that bar chain had been in business for longer than the bar had been using that name and logo in the US.
43	15	So I emailed the chain with pictures of the bar and all the info for the bar.
43	16	They emailed me back to thank me and forwarded it to the legal department.
43	17	Six months later, the bar had a new owner and a new name.
44	0	Caution, this one is sad.
44	1	My uncle's best-friend is a man named Terry.
44	2	Terry was a large man, and quite the bruiser.
44	3	In the mid 90's Terry was at a local dive bar, when he hears a man screaming at a woman.
44	4	He really rips into spewing obscenities loudly across the bar.
44	5	Terry steps in, tells the guy to keep in down, or take it home, nobody wants to hear their problems.
44	6	The girl runs off to the bathroom crying, and the man apologizes to Terry telling him "Sorry man, I just found out she cheated on me".
44	7	The guy promises to keep it down, and Terry walks away.
44	8	When the girl comes back from the bathroom the yelling resumes, and the guy hauls off and hits her.
44	9	The girl runs off and Terry comes charging over to give the man an ultimatum.
44	10	Terry offers to kick the shit out of the guy, or let him walk out on his own.
44	11	The guy chooses the latter.
44	12	A couple minutes pass and the bar phone rings, a call for Terry.
44	13	Terry picks up the phone and almost instantly drops to the floor in agony.
44	14	The man went across the street to a pay phone, called the bar, asked for Terry, then snuck back in and stabbed in 3 times in the back, making him a paraplegic.
44	15	The guy took off running but was caught a month or so later in florida, the girl was still there to identify him.
44	16	Terry is, and always will be in a wheelchair, paralyized from the waist down.
44	17	All for standing up for a girl who was getting beat up by her boyfriend.
45	0	I'm a female education major and I work part-time at a retail store in the mall.
45	1	A little boy of about 3 left his mother and was running into the crowded food court... and it was Black Friday in my low-income area, so there were a LOT of fucking people.
45	2	I yelled for his mom
45	3	but she was in the dressing room, so I ran out and grabbed him before he could get lost in the crowd of people.
45	4	When I walked back in the store the woman charged at me (as I explained that he had run out of the store, there was no way she didn't know what I was doing), took the kid out of my hands, grabbed my ponytail, got in my face, and screamed at me for touching her son.
45	5	Then she went into a rant about how white people need to stop trying to save black babies and that the white man didn't know what was best for black kids.
45	6	Her speech was strewn with profanity and she was yanking my hair the whole time.
45	7	My boss called security but was otherwise useless, and not a single customer did anything.
45	8	I didn't fight back because she had a child in her arms, she was larger, and people in the area have been known to carry knives.
