0	0	I met a girl on XBOX LIVE through a friend.
0	1	She lived in Miami and was named "Jane.
0	2	" Jane got high a bunch, but she always did great in school.
0	3	She had a bubbly personality and yelled at 12-year-olds constantly.
0	4	We really liked her, plus she was amazing at Call of Duty.
0	5	The fact that she was stunningly beautiful didn't hurt either.
0	6	One day, I ask Jane for her cell number.
0	7	At first she didn't answer often; she might've been coincidentally high.
0	8	Then, we ended up having a 4/5 hour straight back and forth texting frenzy.
0	9	After that, we probably talked every day and I could tell she was really into me.
0	10	She opened up to me.
0	11	She told me about her Russian, immigrant parents who died and left her the family business; one that she successfully ran while in college.
0	12	About scars, physical and emotional, that were left from her few years on earth.
0	13	I told her half-truths, and since I lived a couple states away, I never thought it would come back to haunt me.
0	14	One afternoon, "Jane" didn't answer a text.
0	15	I tried later on in the evening and she answered.
0	16	She described to me about how she was just in the hospital after having an altercation with her Ex.
0	17	She told me in haunting detail about how they were yelling at eachother and it eventually led to him punching Jane in the face...a couple time.
0	18	"He just kept hitting me..." It still gives me cold shivers down my spine to this day.
0	19	Here was MY lady, three states away, in complete emotional turmoil.
0	20	I tried to be as understanding and helpful as I could.
0	21	And somewhere along the line, it went wrong.
0	22	To this day, I can't remember what I said.
0	23	All I know is that it ended in her saying "You know what.
0	24	Don't ever talk to me again.
0	25	You're horrible.
0	26	" That is something she has stuck to for over a year now.
0	27	Every now and then, I text the number.
0	28	I hope that one day she'll want to talk to me again.
0	29	Or that she will want to be my wife and ride unicorns with me across the universe.
0	30	But that hasn't happened yet.
0	31	The first meaningful, loving relationship I've had with a woman vanished into thin air through a simple, little text message.
0	32	So, iPlaybunny, or should I say, Regina, if you are out there reading this, just know that I loved you.
0	33	Truly.
0	34	I know I was a bit of an a-hole, but you will always have a place in my heart.
1	0	Copy pasta from an older post on r/WTF before they disabled self posts in that subreddit.
1	1	[Original Link.
1	2	](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/s6ngh/why_dating_sites_should_have_a_user_reviews/)
1	3	This happened some years ago, but it's still the best story I have in my "Personal WTF Moments" arsenal.
1	4	I've been with my seemingly sane GF for 3 years this May, so we're talking 5 or 6 years ago now.
1	5	I was just 21 and a bit lonely, having been single most of my life.
1	6	I broke down and started using a dating website (okcupid).
1	7	I had heard stories about 'crazy' on these sites, but I figured I'd take my chances.
1	8	After weeks of messaging with no responses I finally snag a bite.
1	9	There were some small 'red flags' on her profile; most notably the heavily angled pictures of herself and her way-to-obvious excitement.
1	10	But those things with nothing else didn't tip me off to the crazy I was in store for.
1	11	We messaged each other for a few days, then IMed for a few more days and then started talking on the phone.
1	12	Phone conversations went for a good week.
1	13	The impression I got from her was excitable, friendly and a little quarky, but nothing in our conversations foreshadowed batshit nuts.
1	14	On one Friday night, I had just got home from work and she insisted that we hang out that night; finally meeting face to face.
1	15	I said sure and offered to share my last joint (wasn't going to re-up for a while).
1	16	I agreed to pick her up and we'd hang out at my house and I'd take her home later in the evening.
1	17	I started the solid 30 minute drive to her house as she lived clear on the other side of town.
1	18	Not 5 minutes in to the trip, she calls me.
1	19	The conversation went something like this:
1	20	Her: Hey!
1	21	Could I get your number to give to my mom?
1	22	Me: (confused as she just called me, but ok) Sure 4-1-2-5-5-5..
1	23	Her: Wait!
1	24	4-1 what?
1	25	(she lives in the same area with the same area code)
1	26	Me: 4.... 1.... 2........... 5.... 5....
1	27	Her: 4-1-3-6-7 what?!
1	28	How about you just come in and meet my mother?
1	29	Just so she knows who I'm with.
1	30	I figured sure, why not.
1	31	I'm good with parents typically and it's only fair to her mother.
1	32	I was a little confused about the conversation we had just had, her seemingly incapable of copying a simple phone number.
1	33	But meh, I'm already on the way there.
1	34	I finally get to the house, and she's waiting for me outside.
1	35	The first thing I notice: her pictures were bold lies!
1	36	But I'm not that shallow of a dude, so whatever.
1	37	I can deal with that.
1	38	She wasn't bad, but nothing like her pictures.
1	39	But then, when I pull up and get out of my car, she runs up to me and plants the sloppyist kiss on me I have ever in my life received.
1	40	She's bear hugging me like we're long lost friends and screeching like mad.
1	41	We head in to the house, a homey 2 story + basement obviously furnished by a grandmother...
1	42	actually, her 70 year old mother who I meet in a dining room converted in to a second living room.
1	43	her daughter is going nuts, she's going on and on about what a great guy I am and how nice I am and what fun we're going to have and on and on and on.
1	44	Her mother is just sitting there knitting, smiling and nodding asking small questions like how old I am, where I grew up, etc.
1	45	After a few minutes, the daughter notices the tattoo I have on my right calf; it's a set of thorns busting out of my knee cap in the standard black ink.
1	46	This girl literally drops onto the floor, and forcefully takes my leg and presses it into her lap.
1	47	She then begins to caress my calf and ramble on about all the awesome ideas she has for expanding my tattoo and how awesome they're going to be, like we had agreed to something never discussed.
1	48	I'm taking this all in stride, figuring she's just as lonely as I had been and getting a little excited.
1	49	She gets up off the floor and tells me she'll be right back with her things.
1	50	I talk with her mother for a minute or so, and she comes bowling down the stairs with a duffle bag, some clothing and toiletries, handing me her hair brush, tooth brush, shampoo and some other items I fail to remember to hold on to while she packs her bag.
1	51	It's at this moment I realize I made a big mistake, but I'm an overly patient guy (I have anger problems, so I've learned to not let most shit bother me too much).
1	52	I'm not yet to a point to call it off, but I'm beginning to really want to.
1	53	It wasn't the first batch of clothing that got me there, but when she brought what looked like a weeks worth of clothing down in a second trip.
1	54	An overnight bag says "we're getting laid"; a weeks worth of clothing and toiletries?
1	55	RED FLAG.
1	56	But we're not done yet.
1	57	After the second batch of clothing, she insists that I come up and help her grab a few more things out of her room.
1	58	I oblige, being the nice guy that I am.
1	59	I follow her up the stairs, trailing further and further behind as she's practically running.
1	60	I approach the top of the stars, and have to do a U-turn around a wall to enter her room.
1	61	I turn the corner and holy shit....
1	62	SHE JUST DROPPED TROW!
1	63	She's standing there, pants around her ankles, motioning to me with a come-hither finger and a half-cracked smile.
1	64	Now, the fact that what was underneath was in itself a turn off wasn't my issue, it was her 70 year old mother down the fucking stairs!
1	65	So I tell ask her to "please put your pants back on.
1	66	" She responds, "What, you don't like what you see?
1	67	" I reply "it's not what I see, it's your mother downstairs.
1	68	please put your pants back on.
1	69	" And then a fucking bombshell, "Fine, just come in and shut the door so you don't wake my kid.
1	70	" !!!!!!
1	71	SHE HAS A FUCKING KID!
1	72	That woulda been something to mention.
1	73	I'm not against dating chicks with kids, but a heads up would be nice, especially when you're an 18 year old mother going out on a date with a 20 year old with no kids, and hardly a future at the time.
1	74	I walk in, shut the door, and she drops to the floor again and starts acting like she can't figure out how to put her pants on.
1	75	She going on, "Gaaawwwwd, this is soooo haaaarrdddd.
1	76	Where are the holes on these things?
1	77	" On and on like she's hasn't done this every day of her fucking life.
1	78	It's at this point that I've had enough.
1	79	"Hey.
1	80	Maybe tonight's a bad night.
1	81	I have to be up early tomorrow.
1	82	I'll call you in the afternoon.
1	83	Cool?
1	84	"
1	85	And then, something I didn't expect.
1	86	She starts begging.
1	87	She is on her knees now, still pantless, grabs my hand and begs, "Please please please?!
1	88	Take me with you!
1	89	just for a couple of days!
1	90	We can do anything you want!
1	91	We can have sex!
1	92	You can tie me up!
1	93	PLEASE just take me with you for a few days!
1	94	"
1	95	A FEW FUCKING DAYS!
1	96	This was supposed to be a single evening event, maybe a one night thing.
1	97	But days?!
1	98	Fuck... NO!
1	99	I insist, "No, really.
1	100	I wasn't looking for sex.
1	101	I'll call you tomorrow, I promise.
1	102	It's just a bad night.
1	103	" It's a terrible excuse, but at this point I don't give a fuck, I'm just trying to leave.
1	104	She continues to beg, and I continue to insist; on for a few minutes and then...
1	105	I watch as her face goes from vulnerable and desperate to giving me a "look" like I have never seen.
1	106	She's now scowling at me like I just morphed in to lady-bashing demon-man.
1	107	The following statement, which she whispers like the incarnate of Satan, she turns up the crazy to 11 and solidifies our non-future, "You're just like the rest of them!
1	108	A nothing!
1	109	A no one!
1	110	You're a piece of SHIT and will NEVER amount to ANYTHING!!
1	111	"
1	112	Bam.
1	113	That's that.
1	114	With that, I drop her hand, and walk the fuck out with not a single look back.
1	115	I'm out the door in seconds, in my car and gone.
1	116	But is the crazy done?
1	117	No.
1	118	After driving home and sharing this insane story with my mother (who thought it was fucking HILARIOUS, btw) I remove her from my myspace friends, block her on okcupid and AIM and erase her number from my phone.
1	119	I'm done with this girl, no reason to make it easy for her to get in contact with me again, which I didn't even expect.
1	120	The next day, I get this text from her, "WTF?
1	121	I have one drunk night and you BLOCK ME?!
1	122	Why are you being an asshole?!
1	123	" I didn't respond, as I'm not going to go down any road with crazy, but seriously?
1	124	that's the excuse?
1	125	Alcohol?
1	126	That kind of crazy transcends to sobriety, I have no want in this.
1	127	I only get one more text from her, "FINE!
1	128	Be an asshole.
1	129	I didn't want to be with you anyways.
1	130	I can't believe ONE NIGHT of being drunk and you're willing to end this!
1	131	FUCK YOU!
1	132	"
1	133	And that was that.
1	134	I tell this story to fucking everyone and figured you guys might enjoy it.
1	135	So yeah, that's why I stopped using dating sites and found my SO in a face to face, friends first fashion.
2	0	"I see.
2	1	Here is what happens now.
2	2	"My friends and I are going to leave.
2	3	In one week's time, I will contact you again to set up a meeting to return your wallet, which I found on a sidewalk.
2	4	We will schedule the meeting at the time and place of my choosing, and this time, it will be convenient for me.
2	5	"We'll repeat this exercise every week until you can find a way to be appreciative and politely thank me.
2	6	Once I deem your behavior appropriate, you can leave with your wallet.
2	7	"
3	0	My story was an accident, because I didn't know racism was wrong at the time.
3	1	I was living with my grandparents in a small town of Arkansas while my dad was in Germany.
3	2	I had lived with them for about 4 years before my dad was restationed to Biloxi, Mississippi and I went to live down there.
3	3	Now in Ar we only had 1 black student in our whole school (K-12) and everyone referred to him as "The nigger".
3	4	I never knew that word was bad because everyone said it and he never reacted to it.
3	5	When I moved to Biloxi about half of my class was black and me being the new student I was asked to introduce myself to the class.
3	6	The first thing I said was "Hi my name is yanrogue, I can't believe how many niggers you have here, we only had one in my old school.
3	7	" After a very long explanation everything went much better and I learned racism is wrong.
4	0	I was walking through Best Buy one day a couple years ago and I walked past a rack of books.
4	1	Sitting on the rack was the last book in the Dark Tower series from Stephen King.
4	2	The front cover had the picture of Roland in front of the Tower with the field of roses behind him.
4	3	I held the damn book in my hand and looked it over.
4	4	I remembered being puzzled about why it was in a Best Buy, but whatever.
4	5	I'd read the first 6 and had been waiting for the last one but my spending money was low that week.
4	6	I set it down and decided to come back next week after I got paid to buy it.
4	7	I went back next week and it wasn't there.
4	8	It slipped my mind after that for a bit, but about a month later I went to B&amp;N to get my copy.
4	9	They told me it hadn't come out yet, the release date for the book was 6 months later.
4	10	I preordered it then.
4	11	When the book actually came out I went to pick it up.
4	12	I described the cover out loud to make sure I wasn't crazy.
4	13	The clerk handed it to me and there it was exactly as I'd held it in Best Buy.
5	0	Okay, I've already posted this story somewhere else, but I think it will fit in nicely here.
5	1	I'd never masturbated in my life before this point (I was 18) and really didn't know what to expect.
5	2	It was at a friends 18th, so we were all getting pretty drunk and by some miracle of the divines, I was chatting up a chick WAAAAYYY out of my league, and convinced her to go into another room with me.
5	3	The lights were off when we went in, and we didn't care about doing it in the dark so we just shut the door and headed in the general direction of the bed.
5	4	(We could just see the bed from the light when we opened the door)
5	5	Being my first time, I didn't last very long, couldn't have been more than a minute tops.
5	6	My dick started to 'hurt' so I pulled out and started to jizz over the bed, but having no idea what was going on and not being able to see, led me to believe that I'd broken my penis and was shooting blood everywhere, and I started crying.
5	7	THEN we hear this coughing from the bed, and oh fuck.
5	8	Though I didn't realise this for another minute or so, it turns out we had walked into my friend's parents room.
5	9	They had earmuffs on to sleep through the party, so they didn't hear us come in and slept through our first minute of 'sex'.
5	10	But I had managed to jizz *all over* the dad's face.
5	11	And he woke up, switched on a bedside lamp, to stare dumbly at two half naked teenagers standing beside the bed, frozen in fear, and opened his mouth to speak before realising it was covered in semen.
5	12	He shouted at us and kicked us out of the house, and my friend got a ton of shit from them too.
5	13	We're still mates, and his mum thinks it's a hilarious story, but his dad still hates me.
6	0	That sucks man.
6	1	I have a few of one of my ex best friends taking advantage.
6	2	One that comes to mind is he was behind on some money and I let him borrow my netbook to Skype with his wife while he went overseas.
6	3	It ended up getting smashed or broken somehow, and he wasn't able to pay me back when he returned.
6	4	But he had bought himself a new laptop and tons of stuff for himself before paying me a dime.
6	5	I also let him borrow my 360 while I was overseas so his kid and him could play since it was just going to be sitting in a garage somewhere.
6	6	I never saw that thing again, because evidently it was "stolen".
6	7	That's just a few things of a whole laundry list of things I've done for this dude, but I think a lot of it was my own fault for not being more mindful of him and how he exploited my weakness towards helping friends out.
6	8	I managed to get a 100 dollars out of him for my netbook, (it cost around 250) and that was about the end of our friendship.
6	9	I have a hard time doing good deeds for people after what happened.
7	0	I took my wallet out to donate some money to Buddhist monks, and I heard a loud *PING!
7	1	* I looked around and couldn't find the source of the noise, so I gave them money and went along with my day.
7	2	I drove to a store, and filled out some job applications.
7	3	Back at my car, I discovered that my keys were locked inside of it.
7	4	Fortunately, I kept a spare key in my wallet!...
7	5	which was missing from its pocket.
7	6	The noise I heard was my spare key falling out of my wallet when I went to donate to monks.
7	7	I called my dad and he brought a spare key for me.
7	8	I'm pretty sure karma isn't supposed to work like that.
8	0	I have never shared this story with anyone.
8	1	Only myself and the person it happened to know of it.
8	2	When I was 17, I befriended a 14 year old girl down the street from me.
8	3	She was very much like me, into video games, enjoyed reading, and we were into the same kind of music.
8	4	My father was an abusive alcoholic and my mother had split when I was 5.
8	5	Her situation was reversed, where her dad had split and her mom was an abusive alcoholic.
8	6	So, we meshed extremely well together having come from such tumultuous beginnings.
8	7	Anyway, she started dating a guy who was close to my age.
8	8	I was angry at first, because I admit that I was a bit jealous, and the guy was a world-class douchebag.
8	9	He had dated other girls I knew, treated them like shit, and slid on to the next one once he'd gotten what he wanted.
8	10	So this goes on for about two weeks, until my friend calls me one afternoon and asks me to come over.
8	11	I go to her house, and she's crying.
8	12	He raped her.
8	13	She has hair in clumps where he ripped it out of her scalp as he penetrated her both anally and vaginally.
8	14	She told me the entire gruesome story.
8	15	He came over, they talked, and then he started making moves.
8	16	When she didn't reciprocate and explained she wasn't prepared for such a thing, he took it from her.
8	17	He didn't abuse her face, but she'd later tell me that her ass was bruised and would bleed sporadically for about a week.
8	18	I'm not a violent person.
8	19	I have children now and I'm not even the person responsible for handling their physical discipline (my wife does this).
8	20	When I heard this, I told her to go to the police.
8	21	She refused.
8	22	I begged and pleaded for her to do it, but she wouldn't.
8	23	So, I called the police myself.
8	24	I told them what happened, they said they would investigate it.
8	25	They called her up, asked her what happened, she said nothing - so that was pretty much it.
8	26	She refused a rape kit, refused to tell her parents, refused to tell anyone.
8	27	The guy would send her emails saying she was his little whore, that she got what she deserved, that he'll come over and do it again, really crazy shit.
8	28	So, since nobody would do anything about this - I took matters into my own hands.
8	29	Where I live there's a wooded area behind the elementary school, and it serves as mostly a place for teenagers to hang out, smoke pot, go watch fights, etc.
8	30	I had seen him go in there a few times, sometimes alone, mostly I think to do cocaine.
8	31	I followed him for two weeks, learned his schedule, learned his habits, I'd pay attention to him in school, I wanted to know every single thing about this asshat that I could.
8	32	I'll never forget this.
8	33	Just as the sun was going down, he disappeared into the wooded area, so I followed him.
8	34	I had my backpack on, but tried to be as quiet as I could.
8	35	As soon as he stopped in an area away from everyone else, I blindsided him.
8	36	He fell to the ground, extremely dazed, looks up and says, "what the fuck dude".
8	37	I reached into my backpack and pull out a retractable baton I'd gotten from a friend a year prior.
8	38	I beat him with it.
8	39	Unmercifully.
8	40	There was an incredibly sick, disgusting, sound that his bones made when he tried to speak after I shattered his jaw.
8	41	He kept telling me to 'stop', eventually all you could make out were blood-soaked whimpers, all saying essentially the same thing.
8	42	He would roll over on his stomach, and I'd crack him a few times in the back.
8	43	This goes on for probably a minute and a half.
8	44	He's barely conscious, and his incessant moaning is getting on my nerves.
8	45	So, I grab a jar of Vaseline from my backpack, spread it all over the end of the baton, rip his pants off, and start sodomizing him with the end of it.
8	46	He's clearly in an extreme amount of pain, but that still wasn't enough.
8	47	After I removed the baton from his ass, I smeared the end of it all over his face, and calmly told him that if I ever even heard of him looking at another girl again, that I'd come back and finish him off.
8	48	I told him if he went to the police about this, I'll bring every single girl that I've talked to the police, they'll be able to recite his actions word for word, and that my friend would gladly testify on my behalf of the atrocities he had committed on her.
8	49	Then I left.
8	50	I picked up my stuff and just left him there.
8	51	About an hour or so later I called 911 from a phone inside of a restaurant down the street from my house.
8	52	He was fine, but he wouldn't tell the police what happened, who had done this to him, or why.
8	53	The cops knew it was me.
8	54	They eventually got a warrant to search my residence, but I had already disposed of the baton.
8	55	One of the detectives in the case was actually pretty cool about the whole thing.
8	56	He told me a few times that he knew I was the one that did it, and that he knows why I did it.
8	57	I wouldn't say shit.
8	58	I just kept my mouth shut, and eventually it all went away.
8	59	The kid and his family moved, my friend got counseling for it, and all in all it was a happy ending.
9	0	A few years ago, I was at a college house party.
9	1	I had to take a mean shit, so I went upstairs to the bathroom.
9	2	In a drunken stupor, I decided it would be funny to upper decker the toilet.
9	3	After finishing up and placing the lid back on, I needed to wipe.
9	4	As I glanced around I noticed a robe hanging on the door.
9	5	I flipped it inside out and proceeded to wipe using the arm sleeves.
9	6	I then flipped it back to its original state and hung it back up.
9	7	To this day I don't know who the owner of that house was, but I apologize.
10	0	Found a cell phone in the middle of the street.
10	1	Nobody was around so I figured I should check the contacts to find out who owns.
10	2	Figured "home" was a safe bet.
10	3	I call and start talking after they pick up, only to be torn apart by the owner's mom, who thinks that I've stolen it (apparently the phone was lost the day before and they were looking)
10	4	Anyways, the dude who owned it gave me 30$ for returning it and 10$ for "dealing with his mom".
10	5	So, my good deed was punished but I got a reward for being punished?
11	0	**I did not write this, but its easily the best I've ever read**
11	1	There was a hunter in the woods, who, after a long day hunting, was in the middle of an immense forest.
11	2	It was getting dark, and having lost his bearings, he decided to head in one direction until he was clear of the increasingly oppressive foliage.
11	3	After a what seemed like hours, he came across a cabin in a small clearing.
11	4	Realizing how dark it had grown, he decided to see if he could stay there for the night.
11	5	He approached, and found the door ajar.
11	6	Nobody was inside.
11	7	The hunter flopped down on the single bed, deciding to explain himself to the owner in the morning.
11	8	As he looked around, he was suprised to see the walls adorned by many portraits, all painted in incredible detail.
11	9	Without exception, they appeared to be staring down at him, their features twisted into looks of hatred.
11	10	Staring back, he grew increasingly uncomfortable.
11	11	Making a concerted effort to ignore the many hateful faces, he turned to face the wall, and exhausted, he fell into a restless sleep.
11	12	Face down in an unfamiliar bed, he turned blinking in unexpected sunlight.
11	13	Looking up, he discovered that the cabin had no portraits, only windows.
12	0	I dont know how I remember this...
12	1	In first grade my entire school (k-12, pretty small school) had an assembly for God knows what.
12	2	The assembly was some sort of educational thing where the actors sang and danced to try to get the students to learn "the fun way.
12	3	"
12	4	Now, what makes this interesting was that I was watching some Spiderman cartoons the night before.
12	5	During the assembly, one of the actresses asks the audience "Who sailed the ocean blue in 1492?
12	6	" I was half asleep at this point, but one of my friends poked me and told me to raise my hand, so I did, because I was in 1st grade and I didn't know any better.
12	7	She calls on me.
12	8	I didn't even know the question at this point so a friend whispered it to me.
12	9	I had no idea.
12	10	So, I blurted out the first name that popped into my head.
12	11	"Norman Virgil Osbourne!
12	12	" Yes, I answered her question with the Green Goblin.
12	13	I said this quite emphatically and confidently, by the way.
12	14	The whole auditorium became deathly silent at this point.
12	15	No one laughed, no one murmured.
12	16	I think it was because people were so confused and flabbergasted that there was really nothing anyone could say or do.
12	17	The actress had [this](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvpausW5sE1qaydnc.gif) look on her face for a good 5 seconds before she said, "No, thats not...right.
12	18	But why dontcha come up here and dance with us?!?
12	19	"
12	20	I was very reluctant to, but if you have like 500 people waiting on your move, theres not much you can do.
12	21	As I'm walking towards the stage (again, deathly silent), my older sister, probably in junior high at this point, screams "YEAH WOOOOO GO PMANLY YEAHHHH!
12	22	" It didnt make things much better.
12	23	I get to the stage.
12	24	The music starts and the actress starts squaredancing with me, along with about 10 other cast members.
12	25	After about 10 seconds, I had a "NOPE" moment, and literally ran off the stage, through the side doors, and ran home (wasn't too far, maybe a mile away).
12	26	I'm in college now, and although I think absolutely NO ONE remembers it, I will forever.
13	0	Fuck it!
13	1	Here it goes....
13	2	So I was at work
13	3	and I had to take the Titanic of shits.
13	4	I proceed to go to the restroom and sink that shit.
13	5	Before I flush, I always look.
13	6	But what I saw this time was horrifying.
13	7	This shit was the size of a toddlers leg.
13	8	Flushing isn't an option anymore.
13	9	I panic and start to look for a solution.
13	10	Outside the stall I look in the trash and find an empty Pringles can.
13	11	I proceed to scoop the appendage shit.
13	12	I breathe a sigh of relief.
13	13	I flush the remainder and walk out of the stall.
13	14	My co-worker walks in and says "ooh Pringles!
13	15	Give me one!".
13	16	Before I could say no, she grabs the can and puts her hand in.
13	17	She freaks out looks inside the can and yells, "what the fuck is this!?
13	18	"....All I could mutter was "shit".
14	0	I went out with this guy and we ordered the exact same drink.
14	1	He somehow got shitfaced while I remained sober.
14	2	I guess he didn't drink that much.
14	3	Anyways, he started acting completely obnoxious, being way to affectionate towards me, trying to kiss me on the cheek and putting his hand on my thigh.
14	4	I got up to go to the bathroom and he said "Wait, I have to tell you a secret first!".
14	5	He leaned in like he was going to whisper something to me...and then...he licked my ear.
14	6	I left.
14	7	He followed me to the train and kept begging for a goodnight kiss.
14	8	He still comes into my work all the time, and when my boss sees him walk in, she actually lets me leave and go to the McDonalds next door until he leaves.
15	0	Something similar happened in my town.
15	1	This guy would break into houses and stand over people as they slept.
15	2	One night, a man looked over his wifes shoulder into the backyard and saw some man (the creeper) searching through their bushes and even shot at him (I live in Texas.
15	3	People have guns.
15	4	Deal with it)
15	5	Eventually this dude turns himself in and not only is he my best friends neighbor I sat with this dude at lunch during this whole fiasco of trying to find this stalker and he played it off a little too well.
15	6	Turns out he just did shit tons of drugs.
15	7	Shit tons.
15	8	Doesn't remember half the stuff, like being shot at.
15	9	lol
16	0	The summer between my freshman and sophomore years of HS I had to have a spinal fusion in my neck, it was from a tumor in my 2nd vertebrae.
16	1	They fused skull to C4.
16	2	Fast forward to the beginning of my sophomore year.
16	3	Im sitting in Spanish class and the dean for my grade comes knocking on the door and asking for me.
16	4	He pulls me outside and says to me
16	5	So Mr. Modular_Organs, I understand youve been ditching gym class.
16	6	Im a little confused, but I politely reply that I had a neck surgery this summer, so I cant go to gym class; I study in the library instead.
16	7	At this point class has stopped and the teacher is starting dumbstruck.
16	8	The dean says to me
16	9	Well do your parents know about this?
16	10	Have you cleared it with the school nurse?
16	11	I reply that yes, everyone should know.
16	12	Not believing me he counters with Well, well see about that, Im going to call your parents tonight.
16	13	In the meantime, I expect you to return to gym class.
16	14	I try to explain some more, but finally just say OK so I can get back to my very confused class.
16	15	The kicker is that during this entire conversation, I have a [halo neck brace](http://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1259&amp;bih=585&amp;q=halo+neck+brace) screwed into my skull.
16	16	**Update**
16	17	[I found my student ID from sophomore year](http://i.imgur.com/dDEKz.jpg)
17	0	Driving home on a storm day, I see that a sideroad up to the local golf course is blocked off by flashing barricades.
17	1	I also spy a Mercedes parked past the barricades with it's hazards on.
17	2	I stop and walk up to the car to see if they need help (I'm an EMT), I shine my light in the back seat to see a man slumped over apparently asleep.
17	3	Thinking I've got a few drunks, I move up to the driver window and rap on the glass and shine my light in, the driver is sitting bolt upright, unmoving staring straight ahead.
17	4	My window rapping or light doesn't cause him to blink, flinch or move.
17	5	I look over and the passenger is slumped forward onto the dash.
17	6	This begins to creep me out, I call down to the Sheriff station and request a Code-2 (no lights/sirens) unit up to my location to help me check them out (doors are locked).
17	7	While on the phone I walk back to my truck to get my go-bag, as I'm on the phone with dispatch, she asks me to get a license number for the car just as a PG&amp;E (power company) cherry-picker truck comes rumbling down from up the closed road.
17	8	I move to go around the truck to get the plate number, and the car is gone.
17	9	I talked to the driver of the truck and he said there was a 80 foot tree down across the road, and that he didn't think it'd be open for a day or so.
17	10	So the question is... the hell did the car go?
17	11	Tree up one way, barricades down the other.
17	12	It's kept me a bit unsettled when stopping at accidents/hazards since then.
18	0	I have 2, both similar.
18	1	I have been caught masturbating by my mother twice.
18	2	Both times catastrophically embarrassing for me.
18	3	The first time was nothing unusual.
18	4	In my bedroom, she knocked and then walked in not a second after (what the hell's the point of knocking?
18	5	) I was naked but was able to cover up quickly, but she still knew and walked out.
18	6	I was 17 and I had older cousins, so she asked my aunt about what to do.
18	7	She explained what she did with her two older boys when she caught them.
18	8	This was of course my more gossipy aunt and proceeded to converse with her other sisters and brothers that my mother had come to her with this advice.
18	9	Fast forward a couple of weeks to a family birthday party.
18	10	I feel everyone's eyes staring at me, their glares penetrating my skin.
18	11	My older cousin Allison comes up to me and strikes conversation.
18	12	Eventually asks me, "So how did she catch you?
18	13	" I said, "Um, excuse me?
18	14	" She replied, "Your mom caught you masturbating, didn't she?
18	15	" I suddenly was so overcome with embarrassment that I began to sweat profusely and vomit.
18	16	Vomit lots, and lots.
18	17	Like I said unfortunately there were two times.
18	18	The second time was a little worse.
18	19	Our computer is in the living room (I was too poor for a laptop)
18	20	so I was sitting in the spinny computer chair naked, clothes not even in the room with me.
18	21	I had gotten home from class a little early and figured I had a few hours before my mom came home from work.
18	22	I was horribly mistaken.
18	23	Unfortunately she had been sick and decided to leave early.
18	24	I heard keys on the other side of the front door, and I panicked.
18	25	So I turned the speakers and the monitor off as fast as I could, but stayed seated.
18	26	When she entered, she saw her son sitting quietly at a blank computer screen, butt as naked with an erection.
18	27	Luckily I don't believe she saw that part of me seeing as I stayed facing the opposite direction of her, but still terrifyingly awkward.
18	28	We avoided speaking and eye contact for about 2 weeks.
19	0	I went to go see Terminator Salvation when it was in theaters and had ridiculous gas the entire movie.
19	1	I decided that I was gonna clench and hold in all my farts and save them for a mega-fart during a quiet part.
19	2	So, during the last scene there was a quiet part to which I just let it rip.
19	3	So much pressure was built up that I ended up sharting my pants worse than ever before.
19	4	There was still about 15 minutes left so I decided I might as well just be a man and sit in my poo until the movie finished.
19	5	As soon as the credits came up, I ran to the bathroom.
19	6	Upon inspection I concluded that my boxers weren't salvageable so threw them in the toilet and tried to flush them down.
19	7	The toilet then overflowed onto the floor so I ran out of the bathroom and met up with my friends.
19	8	Upon walking out of the theater one of my friends pointed out that the shit had leaked through my underwear and there was a huge skid mark visible on the outside of my shorts.
20	0	I'm not a trucker, but I used to go on a bunch of roadtrips as a kid.
20	1	One time my Dad was tired from driving and I had to use the bathroom really bad, so he just pulled into a truckstop and let 10 year old me wander into the men's room to do my business.
20	2	I opened the door to the bathroom and there is a 300lb trucker looking fella holding a huge shit in his hands.
20	3	Seriously, this shit was like almost 2 feet long and really fucking wide.
20	4	I don't think he noticed me, or pretended not to see me, and he just casually laid it out on the long wash basin area, pulled a tape measure out, measured it and sort of scoffed.
20	5	He still didn't notice me, and so I just slowly backed out of the bathroom.
20	6	I just walked back to the car and got in, and didn't say anything to my dad.
20	7	I think my brain was still processing what I saw.
20	8	It was like 30 minutes later and I told my Dad I had to use the bathroom again, and he got mad and asked why since he had just pulled over.
20	9	I told him what I saw and he never let me go into truck stop bathroom alone on road trips ever again.
21	0	My vibrator saved me from going to jail once.
21	1	I was camping with some friends, and this was around the time in all of our lives that we were doing plenty of drugs.
21	2	A cop walks up to our camp to check in on us, sees a baggy of weed that my friends complete idiot of a wife left out, and just like that they have cause to search all of us one by one, and our tents.
21	3	It is bad, because I have cocaine in my pocket, and weed AND 4 hits of acid in my tent.
21	4	First they come around one by one and search us, one cop doing the searching while two others watch all of us to make sure we're not trying to make any clever movements.
21	5	Somehow, in the luckiest moment on earth, I have a second when none of them are looking at me or near me, and I manage to get the bullet of cocaine from my jeans pocket to inside my bra, on the underside of my boob.
21	6	It was more important to do it fast than to do it subtle, so if any of them had happened to sweep their flashlight across me in that moment I'd have been fucked.
21	7	When the searching cop gets to me, I make a fuss about wanting a female cop.
21	8	It gets uncomfortable, he makes threats to arrest me and everyone's just telling me to chill out, but it kind of works because he doesn't feel me too closely, I like to imagine because he's worried about a sexual harassment suit or something.
21	9	Anyway, then they move onto the tents.
21	10	I am sweating bullets and trying to keep my best poker face, because they are doing very thorough searches, and my weed and pipe are sitting in the little mesh pocket inside the tent that's for your keys and shit, pretty much the first thing you see when you open the flap.
21	11	My acid is in a bag somewhere on the floor.
21	12	They get to my tent, and I'm about to cry as I hear them unzipping it.
21	13	They've been arresting and ticketing almost all of my friends so far.
21	14	The cop pauses for a second and goes 'whose tent is this?
21	15	'
21	16	Casually I say it's mine, and he asks me to come over there for a second.
21	17	This is a little odd because so far he's been making jubilant announcements every time he's found something illegal all night, but I figure I'm about to get arrested.
21	18	I walk over there, and he pulls me to the side and softly says 'can you tell me what that is?
21	19	' and shines his flashlight into my tent.
21	20	It's my vibrator, laying right on top of my sleeping bag, not even remotely hidden.
21	21	I give an embarrassed laugh and say 'uh, that's a vibrator'.
21	22	He, clearly embarrassed as well, goes 'okay, okay, that's just fine!
21	23	Just wanted to make sure!
21	24	okay then!
21	25	That's fine!
21	26	', zips up my tent, and *moves on to the next one*.
21	27	If he had shone his flashlight maybe 18 inches up, he'd have seen my weed completely in plain sight through the mesh pouch, and surely would have continued searching and found my acid in an instant as well.
21	28	Almost all my friends were arrested or ticketed and ended up on years of probation, and none of them had acid...
21	29	I don't even know what would have happened to me if they'd found cocaine AND acid on me.
21	30	I was the luckiest motherfucker on earth that night, and it's almost entirely thanks to my vibrator.
21	31	I have other great stories about (again) my vibrator and how it lead to a very awkward encounter with my shy male roommate, and also a story about the time I fucked a stripper with a dildo in front of a huge crowd of all my friends, but the vibrator saving me from jail story is by far my favorite.
22	0	The day I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, who had some mental issues (literally in and out of mental hospitals, etc.
22	1	It wasn't all bad, we really were good together at the time)
22	2	is the day I had the police show up at my door.
22	3	She claimed I beat her, raped her, tortured, and abused her.
22	4	She had self-afflicted bruises/cut marks and had been having consensual sex for almost 2 years at that point, which was somewhat common knowledge amongst both families.
22	5	She eventually cracked and confessed to an investigator that she'd only done it because if she couldn't have me anymore, then I couldn't have anyone else ever.
22	6	I never even hit my own sister when growing up, much less ever disrespected a woman, even if she deserved it.
22	7	That entire following year was a social nightmare.
22	8	So many rumors in school.
22	9	After the ordeal people seemed to be sympathetic towards me, but I was just happy to have my name cleared.
23	0	Laughter equals guilt?
23	1	This is terrible reasoning.
23	2	Of course the eleven and nine year old boys thought it was comedy gold.
23	3	I would have suspected either your outraged brother whose overreaction would look suspicious, or the girl who hadn't moved since the evidence was produced.
23	4	Send the two youngest boys away and interrogate the two suspicious characters.
23	5	Present them with stories of desperation and no TP.
23	6	See who cracks.
23	7	I would've had you.
24	0	I was born and raised in North Dakota.
24	1	Back when I was in HS, a group of us would research murders that occurred out in the county.
24	2	We would then go out to find the scenes and film the exploration at night (this was about two years before Blair Witch)
24	3	It was something to do while we got wasted on shitty beer and teenage bullshit.
24	4	Eventually we ran out of places to go (ND = few people, few murders) and got really good at finding abandoned rural farmsteads by driving dirt roads and looking for the signs.
24	5	Rut roads, deliberate tree groves, and old mailbox posts were common markers.
24	6	We were out looking when we spotted a tree grove that was out of place (sure sign) and drove through the field and discovered an old (but not too old) house.
24	7	It had padlocks on the outside doors that were knocked off pretty easily, we dispatched of them and entered the kitchen.
24	8	There were six of us, all with flashlights, and we lit up the kitchen/dining area fairly easily.
24	9	The table was the initial thing you noticed and it was strange because of how normal it looked.
24	10	It was set for a meal and not a bowl was out of place.
24	11	Only thing was, we'd been in dozens of these houses and place setttings were a first.
24	12	Especially unbroken ones.
24	13	As we investigated the area we found the fridge had the disgusting remnants of a full stock, and the cupboards were full of canned and dry foods.
24	14	This was also a first.
24	15	One guy found mail on the counter from early June 1978 and another found a creepy ass TV guide in the living room with UFO's on the cover.
24	16	All the family photos were hanging up.
24	17	Mom, Dad, Bro and Sis in their 1970's glory.
24	18	Furniture was dusty, but in good condition.
24	19	Closets were full.
24	20	Everything was totally normal.
24	21	Which was super abnormal.
24	22	As we dug around the house, we all started to realize that this house had not been moved out of, it had been straight up abandoned.
24	23	Imagine locking the door to your house and never coming back.
24	24	That's the state this house was in.
24	25	Complete unplanned departure.
24	26	We went upstairs and split into three pairs to check out the three rooms.
24	27	Ours was the closest and obviously it was the younger boys room, I can't describe what it looked like too well because almost right away from the hall, we heard the most fucking terrifying scream I've ever had the misfortune of hearing.
24	28	We went running into the hallway and were all yelling questions at each other at the same time.
24	29	After a few (really long) seconds the two screamers caught their breath and said "you have to go in and see.
24	30	" Walking down the hall and through the doorway, I prayed I wouldn't act like a pussy in front of my friends.
24	31	I shouldn't have been concerned because the others were as scared as I was.
24	32	The room itself opened up to the left of the doorframe and centered on the right side of the room was a queenish sized bed.
24	33	Propped up on pillows, with the blanket drawn to the waist, arms on top of the blanket, and worst of all, head turned slightly so it was looking you straight in the eyes when you entered the room was a life sized porcelain doll.
24	34	Snow white skin, jet black hair, cold dead eyes.
24	35	The dead eyes lit up with our flashlights.
24	36	Like she was waiting for us.
24	37	If the head hadn't been turned I could excuse it, but it was turned.
24	38	Ready for when we walked in.
24	39	Ready for 20 years.
24	40	Hasty fucking exits were made down the stairs and into the car.
24	41	It was during the ride we started to get even more creeped out when we realized that even though the house had been abandoned, someone had taken the time to set up that goddamn doll.
24	42	Not packing food, clothes, or family photos.
24	43	Setting up the doll was one of the last things done in this house.
24	44	We researched their names, but got nothing.
24	45	No tragic car accident.
24	46	No grisly massacre.
24	47	No extended family.
24	48	Just a tacky time-capsule in the middle of nowhere.
24	49	We found out that the county had taken possession of the land for nonpayment of taxes, explaining the locks, but never tracked down anymore information on what happened to them.
24	50	Or why they left that fucking doll.
25	0	I've got an adopted half brother.
25	1	I'm 30 now and found out when my mum told me about 5 years ago.
25	2	She started to look up details but he was in his forties and still living with his adopted parents so she assumed they had a close bond and didn't get it touch.
25	3	It doesn't bother me.
25	4	I don't feel like I have a missing brother that I should connect with or anything.
26	0	At my old work place, there was a woman who would eat other people's food without their consent.
26	1	The food was stored in the company refrigerator.
26	2	She ate mine.
26	3	I caught her.
26	4	I got pissed.
26	5	Other people were pissed when they found she was also eating their food.
26	6	Revenge..
26	7	So everyday after I caught her, some of my co-workers and I would buy a dozen donuts in the morning.
26	8	We would offer her a donut first.
26	9	"Sure, take two.
26	10	Three.
26	11	There's plenty.
26	12	" She would take two or three.
26	13	We brought candy and left them in a bowl close to her desk.
26	14	She could not help herself.
26	15	Her weight ballooned to unhealthy proportions.
26	16	Last I heard, she now has health issue related to bariatrics.
27	0	I was talking with this guy from POF, and we decided to go out on a date.
27	1	I ignored the big warning sign that he never wanted to give me his phone number and always called me from a blocked number.
27	2	I had to go pick him up (which isn't a big deal, but I had no clue where I was going and subsequently got lost).
27	3	He directs me to this park and doesn't want to get out of the car to walk around but just have sex with me.
27	4	I refuse.
27	5	Then I wanted to eat, and since he was still with me, I brought him along.
27	6	We get food and then he told me he has no money and I have to pay for him.
27	7	Then I try to bring him home, and he gets me completely lost and frustrated as fuck in Paterson, NJ, which I'm about 90% positive he did on purpose.
27	8	And then he stole my DS Lite.
27	9	He continued to call me for MONTHS afterwards, and I would not pick up at all.
27	10	I knew it was him because he would always call from a blocked number.
28	0	When I was about fifteen, my mom brought a new kitten home.
28	1	One day I was struck with the idea to pull off what I thought was a clever prank.
28	2	I laid a pretty big steamer in kitty's litter box, and carefully buried it.
28	3	About a day later, my mother is scooping the litter box and discovers the turd.
28	4	She immediately concludes that kitty is sick and takes him to the vet.
28	5	They couldn't figure out why kitty would take such a huge shit, and determined that he was healthy.
28	6	I haven't told anyone in my family about this incident.
28	7	To this day, the mystery of "kitty's big poop" is brought up occasionally, and I have to do my best not to laugh.
29	0	I was with my field training officer on what I think was my 2nd week in training when we got a call for a suicide.
29	1	It's the middle of August in the south and we arrive and park in front of the house.
29	2	We step outside and immediately smell death.
29	3	This guy hung himself in a barn and decided to tell no one about his plan to kill himself.
29	4	So he's been marinating on the August heat for two weeks before someone smelled him.
29	5	We walk inside and my partner points out that two rats are eating chunks out of his eyes and tells me to get up there and shoo them away.
29	6	I find a ladder nearby and grab a stick when I lose my balance and grab the nearest thing.
29	7	It's his rotting body and apparently the weight of both of us could not be supported by the beam
29	8	so I land on my back and his entire bloated body lands on top of me and bursts open from his stomach.
29	9	I had his smell on me for what seemed like months, and ever since then I won't deal with that shit anymore.
30	0	My crazy ex-boyfriend told me one day while we were still dating that I loved my 10 week old kitten more than him.
30	1	He asked me that night if he could take him home with him to keep him awake during the drive.
30	2	I said no, but he took him anyways.
30	3	The next morning he called to tell me that he woke up late, jumped out of bed, and "accidentally crushed him with both feet" in his exact words.
30	4	He was all kinds of crazy, and this may even be the least terrible thing he did in our short time together.
30	5	I really hate that guy.
31	0	I found a Gucci purse with $300 in it and an iphone on the street.
31	1	After browsing through the contact, one of my friend worked in Apple store, so he found out the girl's contact.
31	2	She was a tourist from Singapore who visited golf places.
31	3	Here is the thing though, none of the photos in her iphone was her, it was all pictures of places, even on the plane (first class).
31	4	There was some emails of reservation from some fancy hotels they stayed at.
31	5	So I emailed her, and called those hotel to see if she is still there.
31	6	They said no one stayed with that name, only one hotel in golf places remembers her, and they precisely remembers she stayed under a guy's name, who is not her husband, but they act like a husband and wife and have different last name.
31	7	Which means high chances she's probably a spoiled princess mistress.
31	8	The contacts in her phone listed plenty of plastic surgery, limo driver, botox, hair extension, tanning, spa, all beauty related, etc.
31	9	At that time she emailed me back saying i was late by a day, she was already on the way back to singapore, a thank you and said i'm a rare kind soul.
31	10	She told me to return the wallet to the hotel and they will ship it back to her, and told me the guy's name the reservation's under.
31	11	That was the only email i got from her.
31	12	I returned the purse and phone with all contents intact to the hotel, they were surprised and asked for my contact if the guest wants to give me a gift.
31	13	I took pictures of the hotel employee with her name tag, just to make sure.
31	14	I emailed her saying i already returned the purse to the hotel and the name of the employee who received it.
31	15	My gut was right, a few days later, the 'husband' emailed me with angry tone, he said he called the hotel and there was no employee with that name at that hotel and i should return the purse right away.
31	16	I replied by sending him the photo of the employee holding the purse.
31	17	The next reply was short, something about it was the hotel's fault, the purse is with safe with the hotel security.
31	18	No thanks, nothing from this guy.
31	19	I guess he is more worried about the phone's content.
31	20	Possibly proves of his affair.
31	21	Oh yah, bitch replied 'from an iphone' already.
32	0	A few years ago I went to Tokyo Disneyland (while living in Japan at the time).
32	1	I flew from Osaka to Tokyo.
32	2	The flight out was fine, but on the way back they confiscated a teeny, tiny spray bottle of eye-glass cleaner from my carry-on luggage.
32	3	This was actually before the days of restrictions on liquids, so it was extra annoying.
32	4	They told me they could hold it in the plane's cargo and I could retrieve it later.
32	5	Instead I just threw it out.
32	6	The flight was uneventful, and when I got home that night I unpacked my backpack completely to find that I had left a pack of matches in there from my *last* trip.
33	0	Preface: I lost my father in the 9/11 attacks.
33	1	I was 6 years old.
33	2	This past September 11th I went to the memorial ceremony in lower Manhattan for the second time (I had gone in, I think 2003, the year they had children of the victims read the names of the deceased at the ceremony).
33	3	As you probably remember, around that time there was the whole controversy over the "Ground Zero mosque".
33	4	Notorious ass Pamela Gellar had a whole big anti-mosque protest going on after the ceremonies that day (I had emailed her at one point pleading for her to call it off-
33	5	she complimented my writing skills and tried to shove her uberconservative BS down my throat) and my mom decided to go to that.
33	6	We had a bunch of pictures of my father around, along with buttons with his face on them, during the ceremony.
33	7	Before the day even began, I demanded that those things go home with me- asserting that she had the right to protest but that she didn't have the right to tie my father's name and likeness to such vitriolic bullshit.
33	8	The ceremony was nice, went off without a hitch.
33	9	After my father's name was read, we made our way away from the main area, and walked around the adjacent blocks towards the WTC site (families were given the opportunity to leave flowers in the "footprints" of the towers on that day).
33	10	That, also, went off without a hitch.
33	11	I was going home with my aunt and uncle, who weren't protesting that day.
33	12	Their car was parked at our hotel (the Millennium, right across the street from Ground Zero)
33	13	so we headed back there.
33	14	In front of the hotel, the protest had already begun and the crazies were out in full force.
33	15	That anti-Islamic British group (name escaping me at the moment) was there, handing out their literature right in front of the hotel.
33	16	Police were around but couldn't do anything, I understand that.
33	17	I saw two clergymen talking with a TV reporter nearby about how the mosque project was painful for the 9/11 families and disrespectful to the victims, crap like that.
33	18	I was a 15 year old kid and these were older men, religious leaders, but shit I was not willing to leave Manhattan that day without my voice being heard.
33	19	I started debating them on the merits of the mosque project.
33	20	We were on the sidewalk near the front of the hotel, and people just kept coming and coming.
33	21	We were probably pulling a crowd of 50 people near the end and we must have went on for at least an hour and a half.
33	22	Most of the crowd was against me.
33	23	The clergymen were quite respectful, but besides a well-intentioned but angry twentysomething who agreed with me the "audience" reaction was mostly shouts telling me how I was wrong about the points I was making.
33	24	We eventually agreed to disagree.
33	25	I may not have swayed anyone that afternoon, but I was damn proud of myself for getting my ideas in, and for defending my father's memory and the memories of all the other victims from being linked to exclusionism and hatred.
33	26	An Alabama documentary team filmed the whole exchange.
33	27	I got their card that day and they sent me a DVD a couple of months back once they had finished editing the footage.
33	28	Still have to check it out.
34	0	I bought a laptop on craigslist, but when I asked if they could lower the price they lowballed me to $80 for the laptop.
34	1	At the time, this was a $500 laptop.
34	2	I looked at the machine, it was obvious that someone tried to disassemble the machine, and failed at resetting the BIOS password settings.
34	3	The BIOS was stored on nonvolatile chip, meaning it had no battery, nor a reset switch.
34	4	So, I researched for an entire day - finally found the answer: fry the chip.
34	5	It worked.
34	6	I got owner info and did some research.
34	7	Got a phone number.
34	8	Called it right away.
34	9	A lady answered, and I asked "Hi, was your car broken into recently?".
34	10	She seemed shocked, but said "No, but my house was".
34	11	Ah ha.
34	12	She gave me the # of a police officer, and I got in contact with them.
34	13	I worked with police, gave them the guys phone number, address, license plate #, name, everything.
34	14	So then the owner contacts me again &amp; I tell her about the $80 that I paid for the laptop.
34	15	Her &amp; her husband showed up @ my place &amp; gave me $80, but never did say thank you.
34	16	It was fun to be able to get the machine back to the owner, and so was figuring out the puzzle -
34	17	But in the end I would have rather had a thank you than the $80 itself.
35	0	I live near a pretty congested street and once when I was about 13 my friends and I decided to go for a walk.
35	1	I was wearing some white jeans as it was summer time and I was trying to look cute.
35	2	It was the 90's ok?!
35	3	Anyway, we're walking around when I realize that hey, I feel funny maybe it's time to head home.
35	4	I get home and my pants felt a little warm.
35	5	I thought meh, it's swass.
35	6	I go to the bathroom to pee and freshen up and to my shock and horror I had started my period.
35	7	Bright red blood was ALL over the back of my pants.
35	8	There was no way people didn't see that.
35	9	I guess it was less embaressing because I was oblivious, but I was so ashamed nonetheless.
36	0	Boyfriend decided to help friend out and let him stay with him at his apartment.
36	1	Around this time I had come back from belgium with some cigars as a gift to him, now they weren't super expensive but sentimental.
36	2	Suddenly they started missing confronted everyone and he would always put the blame on others.
36	3	So after a while my boyfriend "J" decided to search through his stuff found the reminants of the cigars along with a glass pipe that J got me for my birthday.
36	4	Now if there is one thing I cannot tolerate is someone stealing things that were special to me...he confessed and should feel very lucky I had a staff meeting.
36	5	Fast-forward a few years later we give another friend a place to to stay whats he do steals my flippin pipe.
36	6	Now I was upset, and both these people having the same name I am convinced people with that name bring bad jou-jou into my life.
37	0	During my senior year of high school we took an educational class trip to Italy during spring break.
37	1	One night we were staying in Anzio and for some reason there only seemed to be one bar open in the area which obviously we were hanging out at.
37	2	My friends, myself, a British guy and an Australian guy (both of whom claimed to be friends) were the only people in the bar.
37	3	They seemed like pretty cool guys and we hung out with them for a while until everyone decided we should move the party down to a disco club a couple blocks away.
37	4	Most of the group headed out and started walking down to the club, but 4 of my friends stayed back talking to the Brit and Aussie.
37	5	I was pretty tanked and getting tired so decided to return to the hotel instead of going to club.
37	6	On my way back to the hotel, this car drives passed me and my friend John who stayed back at the bar was hanging out the window drunkenly yelling "Wooo!
37	7	Altomatum!
37	8	Yeeeaaahhhh!
37	9	" as if he was on a rollercoaster or something.
37	10	I was like what the fuck are they doing in a random car in Anzio?
37	11	When I got back to the hotel I called John to make sure he was alright
37	12	and he said they had gotten a ride from one of the guys from the bar.
37	13	I said okay good, be careful.
37	14	The next morning John and his roommate never came out of their room.
37	15	I got nervous and started beating on their door to wake them up, but no answer.
37	16	So I went to my balcony climbed over to their room next door and luckily let myself in through the unlocked balcony door.
37	17	I had to shake the two guys to get them to wake up.
37	18	I asked them what happened last night and they couldn't remember a thing.
37	19	The two girls they were with however, remembered everything and told us how one of the guys from the bar bought the girls each a martini, but the girls refused them saying the didn't like martinis.
37	20	So John and the other guy naturally saw this as free drinks and quickly downed them.
37	21	After a while, they decided it was time to leave so the guy with the car offered to drive them back to the hotel which they accepted.
37	22	The mood changed when they realized they were traveling in the opposite direction of the hotel.
37	23	Having told the guy driving about this, he said nothing and started to speed up.
37	24	They told him to stop and let them out but he refused and kept speeding up.
37	25	They started kicking at the back windows and threatening to kill the guy if he didn't pull over and let them out, so he finally stopped and let them go.
37	26	They had no idea where they were and somehow managed to walk what they figured was 3-4 miles back to the hotel.
37	27	We came to the conclusion that the guy slipped something in the martinis intending to drug the girls.
37	28	The same night one of my other friends decided instead of going to the club he wanted to stay back and smoke.
37	29	He managed to meet a stranger on the street who took him to some house outside the city so he could buy some hash.
37	30	He bought the hash and was able to safely return to the hotel.
37	31	For some reason I expected his story to be a little crazier, but that was about it.
37	32	My only regret was that I pussed out by not going to the club and could've been a part of one of those stories.
38	0	Second ex-girlfriend was waiting for me in the living room about 4 days after we broke up.
38	1	I forgot she had the second key to my apartment.
38	2	She had a cup of wine in her hand and a fuckin knife.
38	3	I fucking ran for my life and called the police.
38	4	They got there in time and arrested her.
38	5	Pants were shat on.
39	0	A friend got arrested with a shit-ton of traffic tickets.
39	1	He called me, and I got up in the middle of the night, drove to another city and spent over $1500 bailing him out (and several hours waiting on processing).
39	2	I didn't hear back from him for a long time.
39	3	Its cool, I figure he's embarrassed about the money.
39	4	7 months later he emails me wanting to come over to my house.
39	5	Guess he wants to talk about paying me back.
39	6	We work out a day/time and he shows up, makes infinitesimal small talk, and then launches into an Amway presentation.
39	7	Threw him out of the house.
40	0	These posts are crushing, so read this.
40	1	My first ever night in India I left my bag in a busy restaurant in Calcutta - money, passport, everything.
40	2	Waiter boy chased me and gave me my bag.
40	3	I could have wept with relief and gratitude.
40	4	He just smiled and absolutely refused to accept any reward.
41	0	When I was little my mom would take me to Kmart and let me wander around the toy section while she shopped (normal in the 70s).
41	1	One day, as I was playing Simone Says, an old man walked up to me and was making small talk while I played.
41	2	He eventually told me to come with him and took my by the hand.
41	3	We walked right down the main center aisle of the store right towards the EXIT sign in the back.
41	4	As we crossed the last row, I looked to the right and saw my mom at the end of the row.
41	5	I told him I saw my mom and had to go.
41	6	I pulled away my hand and ran down to her.
41	7	I didn't tell her what happened because I didn't want to get in trouble for going with a stranger.
41	8	It was several years later that I realized that I had probably narrowly avoided being molested, kidnapped, or worse.
42	0	When I was about six, a car drove by my house while I was outside on a slip 'n slide with my next door neighbor.
42	1	The car slowed down when he got close to me, rolled down his window and started talking to me but he was talking kind of quiet to where I couldnt make out what he was saying, so I walk closer and he asks "dont you go to the school down the street?
42	2	" I said "oh yeah.
42	3	Why?
42	4	" "Because my son said he recognized you.
42	5	" I heard the car door unlock and there was a man in his mid 30s sitting in the back seat.
42	6	Right as the door started to open I feel someone grab me by the collar of shirt and yank me into their arms.
42	7	It was my neighbor's mom.
42	8	She dragged me all the way back to her house and as soon as the driver saw her, he peeled off.
42	9	When we got back to the house she called the cops immediately.
42	10	I didnt even realize how close I was to getting kidnapped until I saw my mom crying when she heard about what happened
43	0	My ex was a pathological liar - he lied about everything.
43	1	I once was at his apartment waiting for him to finish work - he had invited me over.
43	2	Well I am texting him all night trying to figure out why he wasn't there yet.
43	3	He finally arrives at around midnight, saying he has to leave right away to go fix something.
43	4	The next day he is tagged in tons of pictures at a bar with coworkers.
43	5	Another time I showed up and my toothbrush was missing.
43	6	He said my dog ate it and he threw it out, but it ended up being in his closet.
43	7	I would try to figure out why he was lying, and he would make me think everything was in my head.
43	8	He ended up sending me into severe depression where I was doubting everything about myself.
43	9	I was sick to my stomach for weeks.
43	10	Lost a bunch of weight from puking and not being able to eat anything.
43	11	Worst relationship ever.
44	0	**FINALLY**
44	1	When I was in the 8th grade my mother decided that I needed to start eating breakfast.
44	2	It was always offered, but I never wanted to eat in the morning because I have a weird digestive track and still to this day, eating food in the morning makes my stomach hurt.
44	3	Well, she thought it would be a great idea to get Smores flavored Poptarts.
44	4	What more could a kid want, right?
44	5	Chocolate for breakfast!
44	6	Anyways, one morning I was already not feeling good, my stomach had been cramping since I woke up.
44	7	However, this did not stop my mother on insisting that I eat these poptarts.
44	8	So I did.
44	9	As soon as I took that first bite, I felt the shit in my stomach start brewing and boiling like Ol' Faithful in a coke bottle.
44	10	I was ready to spew.
44	11	Now, my school was 25 miles from my house, and the only gas stations were about halfway there.
44	12	There are two gas stations at this halfway point.
44	13	One is really shitty, and the other one is really nice.
44	14	You pass the shitty gas station first, when coming from my house.
44	15	Anyways, I told my mom to pull over immediately when we got to the first gas station.
44	16	I'm clenching my cheeks are tight as I can when we roll up.
44	17	I jump out of the car into the gas station, looked the clerk dead in the eye and asked where the bathrooms were, then he point to the back of the store.
44	18	I rushed down the isle as fast as I could.
44	19	Right when I was about to open the bathroom door, the knob turned and out walked this enormous beast of a man.
44	20	He looked like Santa Claus after a night of hookers and cocaine.
44	21	His face was red and tiny beads of sweat puddled off his bald head into his eye sockets.
44	22	I didn't care.
44	23	This was the worst I've ever had to shit.
44	24	I ran into the bathroom, pulled down my pants and before my ass could even touch the warm (yes, it was still warm) seat, shit was spewing out of my anus.
44	25	I was relieved and luckily it was just one large gush, rather than an ongoing stream.
44	26	I breathed in relief.
44	27	I looked over for the toilet paper, but there was none there.
44	28	I looked for some paper towels, but there was none there.
44	29	Under the sink?
44	30	Nothing.
44	31	I had no idea what I was going to do.
44	32	I was stuck in here, sitting on a warm toilet, with nothing to wipe with.
44	33	I didn't panic though.
44	34	I stayed calm.
44	35	Then, like a sign from god I looked behind me, and up hung on the wall was a framed letter that read "If the bathroom fails to meet expectations, please notify management.
44	36	" I pulled this down, took the back off, and wiped my ass with the letter.
44	37	Afterwards I hung it back up, and walked out, never to go in that gas station ever again.
45	0	I can't imagine the shit Walmart employees must deal with considering their clientele.
45	1	However I had a bad situation turn into a shitty customer experience at one.
45	2	One time I stupidly left my debit card behind at a Walmart.
45	3	Luckily the cashier grabbed it and put it in her register.
45	4	When I finally traced it back to Walmart, the 2 most unhelpful people ever were working the Customer Service.
45	5	I had called about 10 times and the phone just kept ringing and ringing.
45	6	While I was there the phone started ringing again and nobody picked up.
45	7	I mentioned that I had tried to call multiple times and nobody picked up.
45	8	They looked at me with just utter disgust, "we don't answer the phone after 6pm.
45	9	" Ok then.
45	10	When I did get back my debit card, I asked for the cashiers name because I wanted to thank them personally or write to the store manager a nice letter.
45	11	"We don't give out that kind of information.
45	12	" Then I asked for the on duty manager and one of them goes, "I ain't doing that because you are going to complain about us.
45	13	" WHAT?!?
45	14	Well I wasn't going to but now that you mention it maybe I will.
45	15	Another employee finally called the manager and I nicely explained how much trouble the cashier had saved me by grabbing my card and holding on to it.
45	16	Then I asked why they don't answer the phones after 6pm and he gave me this look like, "who the fuck told you that?
45	17	" then looked over at the employees and immediately apologized for his night crew.
45	18	He also gave me the cashiers name right away and I wrote to corporate and the store directly saying how much the manager and cashier had gone out of their way to help me, not mentioning the Customer Service people.
46	0	I saved my (at the time) best friend from a heroin overdose by sticking suboxone under her tongue, which I miraculously had with me a small piece of at the time (was prescribed to it in recovery as part of my medication assisted treatment).
46	1	She got woozy about one minute after coming out of the bathroom when we were hanging out.
46	2	At that point I knew what she had been doing (heroin, behind my back pretty obviously)
46	3	so I told her I would go get this tiny sliver of suboxone I had and have her take it to sober her up since she didn't look so good.
46	4	When I went to grab it she fell down against the wall and went unconscious.
46	5	She was unresponsive to multiple cups of cold water splashed on her face and multiple slaps - lightly at first, then a little harder when she didn't respond.
46	6	I was scared shitless.
46	7	She was unconscious with no heartbeat or respiratory system activity for what felt like ages before the suboxone I had rubbed under her tongue a few moments earlier (perhaps minutes?
46	8	) kicked in.
46	9	I had just found her phone and was about to press send to call an ambulance when she came back to, still way out of it.
46	10	After nursing her back to consciousness and letting the suboxone take its effect, she was okay.
46	11	That day I saved her life.
46	12	About a month later her and my boyfriend who I had been living with for two years hooked up.
46	13	Three times.
46	14	The kicker is that both the place I saved her life and the place they hooked up on numerous occasions were the same place; my boyfriend's mothers house, which wasn't somewhere any of us went often, either.
46	15	Fuck them both.
46	16	:(
47	0	My girlfriend told me the week before I went to college that I got her pregnant knowing that we were not going to date long distance.
47	1	She sent me a picture of a stock photo pregnancy test she cropped that was positive I literally just Google searched "Positive Pregnancy Tests" and it was one of the first ones.
47	2	I made her come over and take another one.
47	3	It was negative, she left.
48	0	When I was in high school I got friendzoned and ultimately cut off by a girl named Jess that broke my heart pretty badly.
48	1	She explained to a mutual friend that she never wanted to speak to me again.
48	2	A year or so after that happened, we got a new student in my English class that was pretty creepy.
48	3	Whenever he participated in class discussions, his input was usually very dark and morose.
48	4	He often chose to sit in the back corner of the class away from every one else, and for that we called him "Puerto Rico.
48	5	"
48	6	One day out of the blue, Puerto Rico calls me at home.
48	7	I never talked to him or gave him my number, he looked it up in the phone book.
48	8	He proceeds to say "Hey, Dcoil1, this is Puerto Rico.
48	9	Do you know Jess' phone number?
48	10	"
48	11	"Uh...hey, Puerto Rico.
48	12	Um...no, I don't know her number.
48	13	"
48	14	"Do you know anyone who does?
48	15	"
48	16	"Uh...no.
48	17	Sorry, buddy.
48	18	"
48	19	I didn't actually know her number, but I sure as shit wouldn't give it to him if I did.
48	20	The next day I'm talking to my friend Chris and he says that Puerto Rico called him up that day as well and asked the same question.
48	21	We laughed about it and said we should probably tell Jess if we see her.
48	22	Later that day I'm walking to class and Jess and her friend pass by me.
48	23	As soon as I see her I excitedly say "Hey, Jess, craziest thing happened yesterday.
48	24	Puerto Rico called me up out of nowhere and wanted your number!
48	25	You might want to watch out for..."
48	26	She cuts me off in mid-sentence and yells "Yeah, I'm sure, Dcoil1!
48	27	You're so full of shit.
48	28	You heard Chris' story and wanted an excuse to talk to me so you thought you'd tell me Puerto Rico called you too!
48	29	"
48	30	At that point her friend grabbed her by the arm and pulled her away.
48	31	I just stood there in stunned silence, mouth literally agape.
48	32	It was probably the first time I'd spoken to her since she told me to fuck off, and I though I was trying to do the right thing, she decided to be a bitch even more.
49	0	Yeah...
49	1	We went out to a nice restaurant that she liked.
49	2	(2nd date)
49	3	We had a nice dinner and everything was good.
49	4	Check came, I paid with my debit card.
49	5	It was declined.
49	6	(apparently, there was an issue with my direct deposit and a fair amount of money didn't get into my bank which had no noticed)
49	7	Ok, here's my credit card that I carry just in case.
49	8	ummmmmmmm Where's my credit card?!?!?!?!
49	9	(I had just went on a trip and cleaned out my wallet, credit card sitting on desk at home)
49	10	Checkbook?
49	11	That's at home too.
49	12	Cash?
49	13	Who the hell carries cash?
49	14	After sheepishly explaining the situation and promising to pay her back ASAP, she paid.
49	15	Walked out to the car and found ..... no car.
49	16	After calling around, discovered the car was towed!?!?!
49	17	(Towing company was overly aggressive and towed my car when they shouldn't have)
49	18	Took a cab to the towing yard.
49	19	No money, she had to pay for cab.
49	20	Got into argument with ignorant tow truck guys who refused to release my car even though it was parked properly and we had restaurant receipts to prove it, etc.
49	21	$125.
49	22	She had to pay.
49	23	Worst date ever for me.....
49	24	Interesting post-date tidbits
49	25	---------------------------
49	26	- She was a trooper and we're married now, lol
49	27	- I always now carry 3 ways to pay, that just isn't happening again.
49	28	- We ended up buying a house in the town where the tow truck company is
49	29	- The tow truck company mysteriously burned down one night.
49	30	I had NOTHING to do with that, but I could definitely see someone torching that place, though my theory is they burned it down for insurance money...
49	31	A few more post-date tidbits I forgot ...
49	32	---------------------------
49	33	- Cab drove us right by the house we ended up buying when we moved into that town (though we didn't know it at the time)
49	34	- A couple weeks after my car got towed, the mall/building got rid of the towing company and opened the whole thing up due to all of the 'false towings' happening.
50	0	I once grabbed a kid to prevent him from getting run over by the little train they have that takes parents and their kids around the mall.
50	1	My reward was to get bitched out by the kids mom for touching her kid.
50	2	He almost got hit a second time, but his mom pulled him away at the last moment.
50	3	I walked right past them and said, "Too bad his ass didn't get hit.
50	4	That would have been entertaining.
50	5	"
50	6	The look on the mom's face was murderous, but I didn't really care.
50	7	It was a completely shitty thing to say, but she was a bitch and a negligent parent.
51	0	when I was 11, I was bullied a lot.
51	1	I LOATHED this kid on the schoolbus named "Pete" would smack me on the back of the head even though I would mind my own business.
51	2	we got off the same stop because our houses were on the same street.
51	3	One day I got fed up, when we exited the bus I found a huge stick and started chasing Pete.
51	4	he got pretty fucking scared and started sprinting away from me.
51	5	he ended up running into the middle of an intersection and getting hit by a white SUV.
51	6	he was in the hospital for 3 weeks.
51	7	suffice it to say that he never hit me again.
52	0	So this didn't happen to me but I heard this from a friend when I lived in Japan.
52	1	The word "nigai" means bitter in Japanese.
52	2	But when you drink or eat something bitter you usually shout in surprise and say "nigga" because the i sound is often omitted just because it's easier.
52	3	So friend is sitting at a coffee shop and there are black people at the table beside.
52	4	He sits down with his friends and sips his drink then yells nigga.
52	5	The man at the table next to him turns and kind of laughs, but he realizes what he's done (since that word is very famous thanks to hip hop music) and feels the need to explain.
52	6	With his very poor English he tries to explain that he was given the wrong drink and didn't like it.
52	7	What came out was "I hate brack.
52	8	"
53	0	This one is probably going to get buried but here goes.
53	1	Several years ago, I had a very easy job doing IT for a school and me and the district managers were very good friends.
53	2	Well, a friend of mine was posting on myspace at the time (I know, so long ago, right?
53	3	) about being total destitute and living at his parents place while being around 24 at the time.
53	4	So, I talk to my boss and there happen to be an opening at another school that we did work for.
53	5	I had him send in his resume to my boss and he got the job.
53	6	He lived out of town when he was offered a job (5 hours from where I live) and he had no place to stay and no money to get a place.
53	7	So I offer to do several things.
53	8	1) Help him move
53	9	2) Stay with us rent free for like 2 months while he got on his feet
53	10	3) Only made him pay 1/3 of the rent and utilities.
53	11	So I fly down to his hometown, help load up the uhaul and drive back to my city and to my place.
53	12	We sign a new lease with a new townhouse (he didnt sign it, stupid stupid me) and we moved in.
53	13	From that point on, he refused to help with ANYTHING at the house stating "I didn't make the mess so I am not going to help.
53	14	" No dishes, no vacumming nothing.
53	15	No help at all with anything.
53	16	Then he started getting very reclusive only staying in his room and never opening the door and would drive 5 hours every weekend to his hometown to be with his pyscho fucking girlfriend.
53	17	Well shit hit the fan with my new job I got that was a huge increase in pay
53	18	and I got let go and couldnt go back to my old job with my old awesome boss.
53	19	So, instead of trying to return the favor of me helping him out, he decides to just up and move out to a new apartment on the other side of the city.
53	20	A month or two later just quits his job at the place I got him work with nearly no notice and just bailed on us all.
53	21	Fuck if I will ever help anyone again.
53	22	That was the last straw.
53	23	(though we (my wife and I) fell victim to niceness several times after that and got horribly burned each time.
53	24	I fucking hate people.
54	0	On another account I had posted some pictures of myself to /r/gaybears.
54	1	Nothing to hardcore, just some beefcake, but I was there in all my glory.
54	2	About three weeks later I went to a party that my sister threw.
54	3	While I was there one of the older guys from her church, he's in his 50's, acted extremely weird around me at first.
54	4	A few hours later, though, I went on a beer run and he said he'd go with me.
54	5	Yeah... as we drove he suddenly blurted out "I saw your pictures.
54	6	" Once I clarified which pictures he said "Uh... and... uh...
54	7	I was wondering if.. uh... you wanted to get a beer sometime.
54	8	"
54	9	Yeah...
54	10	I wonder what his wife would think of all that.
55	0	When I went back to grad school, I lived in small apartment with my girlfriend.
55	1	One day I was taking shower and hear a knock on the door.
55	2	My gf goes to answer it.
55	3	We didn't usually get many visitors, so I was curious enough to peek out of the bathroom to see who it was.
55	4	I see that my gf makes no offer for the mystery visitor(s) to come in, but still seems to be politely listening.
55	5	I poke my head out of the bathroom door a bit farther, then I see a bible and nametag.
55	6	This is like the third time within recent memory some bible beaters have been at my door (despite the no soliciting sings).
55	7	Fuck this.
55	8	I walk out where everyone can see me, naked as fuck except for these bright teal shower gloves (think Michael Jackson glitter gloves, but teal).
55	9	To complete my ensemble, I have a partial chub from the "washing" I was doing right before they knocked on my door.
55	10	Once everyone sees me (with teal gloves and chub), I say with a straight face: "Hey, we gonna do this or what?
55	11	" The bibleboys stop talking, slowly step back trying not to look at my junk, and one finally says, "Uh, thank you.
55	12	" My gf was a real trooper, too.
55	13	She just stood there holding the door open, looking at them, not cracking even a smile.
56	0	Not trying to generalize but something that seems to occur with kids who get that kind of money from their parents is the devaluing of other people's money.
56	1	If you're someone who sees a $10k check (and I'm sure a lot of other handouts) regularly and suddenly paying someone back $500 seems like no big deal and other things become a bigger priority.
56	2	Happened to me - Had to call out a well off friend who asked for a loan because he didn't want his parents to know he was spending all his money on bar tabs.
56	3	He also go some sort of yearly gift.
56	4	When I brought it up when he hadn't paid me back after 3 months he nonchalantly said "Damn dude, didn't think it was a big deal.
56	5	It was just $250.
56	6	I was gonna get it to you..."
57	0	When I was about 17, a gust of wind ripped my car door out of my hand and into the car that I was parked next to.
57	1	I went into the store and had the manager call for the owner of the car using description and license plate number.
57	2	No one came forward.
57	3	I went back out to the parking lot and waited for the owner to show.
57	4	When the owners arrived, I told them I was sorry that I had dinged the side of their door.
57	5	I showed them the small dent and offered to exchange insurance information.
57	6	The wife was a straight up bitch.
57	7	She started huffing and puffing, walking around her car and finding other dents in her fender, rear quarter panel, places that it would have been impossible for my door to have caused damage.
57	8	I told her that I did not cause the other dents and she should be lucky that I was an honest person, as most people would have just found another parking spot and not told her at all.
57	9	Her husband came to my rescue and calmed her down and explained to her how I could not have caused the other dents.
57	10	He even opened up my door to show her it wasn't possible.
57	11	She went on and on and wanted to exchange insurance info.
57	12	Her husband ushered her into their car and told me to just go.
57	13	He said he wasn't worried about the dent I caused and thanked me for being so honest.
57	14	As they were pulling away, his wife glared at me until they were out of sight.
58	0	Found a dog wandering the road so I picked it up.
58	1	It had no nametag, just a rabies tag, and it was after hours at the vet's office, so it spent the night.
58	2	I had two other dogs and cats of my own and the dog had fleas, so it had to be locked in the spare room for the night.
58	3	Tore my spare room up.
58	4	Next morning, I called the vet's office on the rabies tag and let tbem know I 'd found the dog.
58	5	They knew the owners but wouldn't give me the name or number, basically telling me to wait it out until they were able to make contact.
58	6	As it neared 5 o'clock and still no callback, I called and asked if I could simply bring the dog up to stay at the office until the owner picked it up, being as it had fleas and was tearing up my house.
58	7	They told me to bring it in, no issue.
58	8	Turns out this office was about a 20 minute drive from me, and when I got there, they told me I couldn't leave the dog unless I paid for it to be treated with flea meds and paid for a night of boarding.
58	9	I told them that was totally fucking stupid, they knew who the owner was and shouldn't they bill the dog's OWNER?
58	10	Nope, and they wouldn't let me leave the dog without paying.
58	11	Last time I ever picked up a lost pet.
59	0	When my best friend and i went backpacking in Europe - we had just left Oktoberfest in Munich and got on the night train to Paris.
59	1	In the mix of things we accidentally switched tickets, i found my cabin with 5 quiet Asian travelers and we all went to sleep pretty much right after the train started to go.
59	2	After the heavy amount of partying that took place, that sleep was one of the best ones that i've had.
59	3	I woke up in the morning feeling refreshed and went to look for my friend a few cabins away, but she was gone.
59	4	After locating my her and seeing how much she looked like shit, she proceeded to tell me that her cabin was made up of 5 drunk french men, 5 very drunk french men.
59	5	They had a good 1-2 hours of being rowdy and loud for a while then things finally started to quiet down in the cabin.
59	6	In the middle of the night my friend felt someone smack her head.
59	7	She thought it was the very burly drunk men sleeping in the bunk right across from hers and just moved farther back into the bunk towards the wall.
59	8	When someone smacked her head again.
59	9	She lifts her head up and something falls off.
59	10	she touches it and its poo.
59	11	the 250lb man was shitting his pants and throwing poo at her in his drunken sleep.
59	12	She screamed ran out of the bunk and found someone that works on the train.
59	13	The woman laughed at her and directed her to the bathroom, where the sinks water pressure was equivalent to the water pressure of something with low water pressure..
59	14	(i can't think of a clever analogy right now).
59	15	She refused to go back to the bunk, had to go find an empty seat for the duration of the train ride.
59	16	So happy to finally share that.
60	0	Was 16, in the mountains in Springville, Utah.
60	1	We were in our tent, and you couldn't see any stars through the thick canvas.
60	2	There were four of us in the tent.
60	3	About 1 hour of being in the tent, a light appeared that we could see through the canvas.
60	4	We got out and looked at the weird looking light that was in the sky.
60	5	About 30 minutes later it slowly starting moving down, and its light was lighting up the mountain valley.
60	6	We were freaked out, starting swearing at it, shaking out bb guns at it.
60	7	It eventually stopped again for another 30 minutes or so.
60	8	At that point, it split into 2 light objects.
60	9	One light got a blue flame and shot off into the sky in one direction.
60	10	The other object did the same.
60	11	No idea wtf it was.
60	12	But we saw the same lights in the mountains for several days from our houses in the valley.
61	0	A few years ago I worked for an apartment rental agency in a customer service role.
61	1	One day a girl called to ask if I could email her pictures of one of our apartments because she was currently in a different city.
61	2	I told her that this was a non-standard request so it might take a few days, and that our policy was to not rent an apartment to a tenant who hadn't seen it in person.
61	3	Two days later I was able to get one of the leasing agents to take the pictures she requested (we had to get the current tenant's permission first) and I emailed them to her, reminding her she would need to visit before signing the lease.
61	4	She called the office a few minutes later asking to speak with me.
61	5	Her response was that I'd promised I would send her pictures that same day, also that I'd promised her she could lease the apartment over the phone, and that I was now discriminating against her by preventing her from renting that apartment.
61	6	Oh, and also she was going to take me to court for discrimination.
61	7	She then asked to speak to my manager and shortly thereafter *faxed* over a written complaint about me and how horribly she had been misled and abused by me.
61	8	I ended up on probation at work because of this girl who I went out of my way to help.
61	9	Fortunately she never tried to follow up after that because honestly I have no idea what her game was.
62	0	I had a blind date with a woman and everything went amazingly well.
62	1	We were on the same wavelength on everything and had one of the greatest nights of my life.
62	2	A couple of days later, we went out on a second date.
62	3	As dinner ended, she looked at me and said that she was having a great time and really liked me.
62	4	In fact, she said that she liked me enough to know that I was the one and that she wanted to know how serious I was about our relationship.
62	5	I was sort of stunned, then looked at her and reminded her that we were on our second date.
62	6	She said that our ages (we were both mid-30s at the time)
62	7	we knew enough to know what we were getting in to.
62	8	She wanted to have a family and have kids, and she did not want to wait.
62	9	She said that I was the one she wanted to have her kids with.
62	10	I sat there dumbstruck.
62	11	When I didn't answer immediately, she pushed again.
62	12	I just said that we should take it slowly and see what happened.
62	13	She erupted, saying that she didn't have time for that and needed to move quickly.
62	14	When I was still too dumbstruck to speak, she started flipping out in the restaurant.
62	15	She stormed out, screaming at me.
62	16	I got a call from the woman that set us up asking what happened and why the woman was "heartbroken.
62	17	" I tried to explain, but I am not sure she really believed me, or at least not enough to try to set me up with anyone else.
63	0	I was 20.
63	1	Living in a mountain town during the summer.
63	2	A neighbor is going on vacation.
63	3	He asks me "Hey, think you could mow my lawn next week when I"m gone?
63	4	I'll give you 50 bucks!
63	5	" I'm like "sure.
63	6	" so he gives me the 50 up front and heads out.
63	7	That's great.
63	8	So, next week I head over to mow the lawn and find it freshly mowed.
63	9	I'm looking around and someone comes out and says "Oh yeah, I was bored so I went ahead and mowed it.."
63	10	and I said "Oh.. ken paid me to mow it" and he says "Ahh, our secret man!
63	11	Don't worry about it".
63	12	So it's like.. hmmm, free 50 bucks?
63	13	maybe not so bad.
63	14	So, the guy comes back from vacation and stops by.
63	15	I didn't have the heart to take the money so I told him what happened and gave him back the 50 dollars.
63	16	He looks at it and is like... "Come on man...."
63	17	"Huh?
63	18	" "I gave you $100 dollars to mow the lawn!
63	19	"
63	20	Then he acts like "Well, if it's that important to you then you can just keep the extra 50, but I'm disappointed!!
63	21	"
63	22	WTF!!!
63	23	I know for a fact it was 50 dollars because I bought weed with it immediately!
63	24	I then got paid and saved out 50 dollars to pay you back with.
63	25	I'm a lucid individual, I know for a fact that this is what happened, but his judo verbal tactics left me with no where to go.
63	26	I just had to swallow my pride and say "Well, I'm not giving you 50 extra dollars when I know for sure that you only gave me 50.
63	27	If you feel ripped off then I apologize, but you are wrong.
63	28	" and he was like "you probably need it more than I do anyway.
63	29	" FUCKER
64	0	Used to work for Walmart, not once did a good deed go unpunished.
64	1	If ever I found a wallet/purse i would carry it by the corner at arms length, and open it looking for an ID while under a camera (still keeping it at arms length).
64	2	That way when they accused me of stealing (which I never would) there was plenty of vidoe coverage to protect me.
64	3	Same with cellphones, I would look for a contact Mom or Dad first (if I couldn't find one I would check recent calls), but I would always handle the thing like Plutonium.
65	0	Out of context, this is an incredibly normal story, but it suddenly gets very creepy after a few months.
65	1	One night I went out with a friend near Liverpool St, London.
65	2	We were in a pub and I wanted to draw more money out so we could get more drinks.
65	3	I left the pub and walked down toward the cash machine, drew out my cash, then came back.
65	4	As I went to enter the door to the pub a cabbie pulled up and got out and said "Hey, excuse me?
65	5	" I said hello back.
65	6	"I just won the lottery!
65	7	" he said.
65	8	"I've got champagne and I'm going to have a party, do you want to come?
65	9	" I laughed it off and told him no thanks and went into the pub.
65	10	Months later I was reading the paper on the tube and saw that a serial rapist had been arrested.
65	11	He was a cab driver operating in London and was luring women into his cab by saying he'd won the lottery and had champagne.
65	12	I'm guessing it was the exact same guy.
66	0	I drove an over the road straight truck with my Dad for a little over a year, spending a good 3 months away from home at a time.
66	1	The coolest story to e is that we almost got to haul the Smashing Pumpkin's concert gear, but had to turn the load down because we did not have enough straps and all the gear was on wheels.
66	2	And my Dad hauled the piano that Paul McCartney played at a concert the night before.
66	3	And we also got paid a lot of $$$ to haul an aluminum tube that weighed only 47 lbs across the country.
66	4	Beauty of expediting.
66	5	The first WTF story I have was last winter in the northeast.
66	6	You guys aren't the most cautious drivers to begin with and when the snow hit MY GAWD.
66	7	During one stretch of highway about 30 miles I saw no less that thirteen cars and two big rigs eat shit or pass by the wreckage and remnants of one that had not too long ago.
66	8	A few of them definitely being a fatality.
66	9	And in Leeds Utah, we witness a wreck where a lady was weaving between cars going WAAAY too fast for the bend up ahead and hit the guardrail, over corrected and careened off into the ditch and rolled a few times.
66	10	We stopped the truck and bailed out to help.
66	11	She had been wearing a seatbelt but the violence of the rolling slipped her out of it.
66	12	She was unconscious and began to choke on her vomit.
66	13	My Dad and another guy who stopped pulled her out and laid her on her side and called 911.
66	14	They were given instructions by the dispatcher until the ambulance arrived.
66	15	It was a bit of a story in Leeds and I followed the articles on the web.
66	16	She's okay, no brain damage, but is expected to make a full, if not lengthy, recovery.
67	0	I actually have a good story about military dogs, and this seems like a good place to tell it.
67	1	Somewhere in Scandanavia, I think it was Sweden, the navy uses dogs when they board boats they suspect are smuggling drugs.
67	2	The drug runners have a way of countering the dogs; they wear pads around their left arm, and offer it to the dog to clamp on to.
67	3	When the dog bites, they stab him with their free right hand.
67	4	There was a particular dog by the name of Zeus who was released on one of these boats.
67	5	A smuggler tried the padded arm trick, and was subsequently disemboweled by Zeus.
67	6	It's policy that when a police dog kills a human, they are put down.
67	7	I guess the boys didn't like the idea of putting down one of their fellow officers, so Zeus was snuck out of the country and brought to a german shepherd breeder in Canada.
67	8	The American military heard about Zeus, and asked the breeder if she would breed him with one of their Mexican border patrol dogs and ship back the offspring.
67	9	She agreed, and they shipped up their dog.
67	10	The breeder said when she got this american dog, it was absolutely out of control, way too aggressive.
67	11	As a responsible breeder, she set to work retraining the dog so it wouldn't be such a danger to people.
67	12	When the Americans asked for their offspring, she refused.
67	13	[Zeus' offspring, Max](http://i.imgur.com/kCHrt.jpg) (not with the psycho dog).
67	14	He's trained in Schutzhund, is incredibly strong and obedient, and he knows secret German commands
68	0	Lent a boss $250 to buy this pos car.
68	1	He had been diagnosed with ball cancer, I felt bad.
68	2	And I had some extra scratch I could lend.
68	3	He buys the car, which was a decent car and he got a great deal because it was from a relative.
68	4	Sells it for $2500, stopped offering be jobs (it was independent contract) haven't heard from him since.
68	5	Fuck.
69	0	One time I took a dump that was so long, that even when trying to aim it down the hole at the bottom of the toilet it still stood up out of the water.
69	1	When I pinched it off it had to fall one way.
69	2	It fell forward and scraped across the backside of my ballsack as it fell.
69	3	Tickled a bit, but was mostly startling more than anything.
69	4	You don't expect to feel something on the back of your ballsack when you're taking a dump.
69	5	Thought it could be a spider or something...but then I realized...
70	0	When I was in the Navy, I was standing watch in the engineroom one day.
70	1	Or night, I don't remember.
70	2	I was on a submarine, so you lose track of those kinds of things.
70	3	Anyway, it was during a workup for a reactor safety exam, so all of the engineering dept was tired from running drills during their off hours, when they would normally be sleeping.
70	4	About halfway through my 6 hour watch, I had to shit, but I didn't want to wake someone up to stand my watch while I pooped.
70	5	So I held it in like a boss, for 3 hours, until my relief came.
70	6	By the time I was screaming down the p-way to the water tight hatch, I had to go so bad
70	7	I was almost puking.
70	8	But the water tight hatch that separates the engineroom from the forward compartment is about 2 feet off the ground - too high for me to just bend my legs at the knees and scoot through.
70	9	My anal clench is the only thing holding back this fecal maelstrom.
70	10	So I un-dog the hatch (it's a big mechanism, takes a few seconds to open) and lift one leg to get it through - and my colon unloads with a fury unmatched.
70	11	Tube 1 has been launched, and the charge is currently running out of my boxers, out through the leg of my coveralls, onto the deck, and rolling a few inches to the horrified gaze of the rest of my watch team standing behind me.
70	12	Through the strange mixture of embarrassment, shame and nausea from having to poop so bad, I can't manage to say anything except "Oopsies".
70	13	Luckily, I'm an engineer
70	14	so I have a rag in my back pocket, so I go to scoop it up, bending over straight-legged and cheeks hugging like high school sweethearts.
70	15	I walk through the hatch with shit in hand and head forward.
70	16	The first room you hit when you head forward is the mess, where most of the crew who is awake and not on watch hangs out, watches movies, plays games, etc.
70	17	Right now, it's full of offgoing watchstanders having whatever meal is being served.
70	18	I go to toss the rag in the trash, and one of my buddies who watched this whole thing unfold is standing in the middle of the mess deck and shouts "Hey Mikey, wtf are you doing?
70	19	You can't throw shit in the trash.
70	20	" - which is actually true.
70	21	We compact all of our trash and jettison it - anything that has liquid in it cannot be compacted or it will ooze out the side of the compactor and possibly squirt the poor kid that has to operate the machine.
70	22	So I'm standing there with a piece of shit in my hand, half the crew is there, chewing on chicken wheels and staring at me and my bundle of joy.
70	23	That was the most embarrassing thing I think I've ever had to endure.
71	0	I got everything confiscated; deodorant, water, liquid hair soap, tweezers, but was able to smuggle a lighter through Amsterdam, Kuwait, Berlin, and Australian security check points, I was even frisked multiple times.
71	1	I just kept forgetting I had the lighter.
71	2	So much for recognizing the actual threat...here take my Old Spice.
72	0	Playing Xbox at my house, I look to see that my controller needs new batteries.
72	1	Searching through my home, I find no batteries and decide to walk to the nearby liquor store to buy some.
72	2	It was around 7:00 p.m.
72	3	so it was getting a little dark.
72	4	Down the street I see a small figure starting to walk towards me.
72	5	Puzzled, I walk toward him hoping to see who he was.
72	6	What I happened next was the most confusing moment of my life.
72	7	The figure was a kid of around 5 or 6 completely naked except for his underwear.
72	8	He flips me off and starts to trash talk me.
72	9	"Get over here bitch, come fight me!
72	10	"
72	11	"I will fuck you up bitch come on!
72	12	"
72	13	I was so confused I didn't know what to say.
72	14	I stood there dumbfounded wondering what the fuck is going on.
72	15	I started to run toward him to stop him from shouting.
72	16	He looked and ran, screaming at the top of his lungs, and disappeared into the nearby alley.
72	17	I went at got my batteries and went home.
73	0	Once I was at a mall and had just bought a new wallet.
73	1	I figured that, because I had no need for my old wallet, I'd experiment with it.
73	2	I then walked to a busy part of the mall and dropped it, then sat down in the distance to watch what happened.
73	3	The first two groups of people were unphased.
73	4	Then, a group of black teens, all clad in sagging jeans and snap backs, walked over my wallet.
73	5	one screamed out "DUDE I FOUN' A WALLET!
73	6	" They all start freaking out and decide to pick it up and open it.
73	7	Upon opening and discovering it was empty, they are yelling and freaking out about how disappointed they were.
73	8	One screamed out that it was screwed up, to which another replied "TO THE MAX!
73	9	" They then decided to walk off with the wallet anyways.
73	10	I couldn't contain my laughter.
74	0	Driving out in the boonies with some friends in a pickup.
74	1	Crew cab with a dog in the back and leashed to the truck.
74	2	Driver pulls over so he can step off to the side of the road and take a leak.
74	3	We can barely see him from the glow of the parking lights, headlights turned off.
74	4	His dog starts going fucking crazy.
74	5	CRAZY trying to jump out of the back, barking, snarling, tugging at the leash and my buddy just yells at it to calm down.
74	6	Zips up, walks across the front of his truck and just as he turns to open his door something massive whizzes by the front.
74	7	We all give a "WHAT WAS THAT?
74	8	" and the dog, who was trying to jump out of the right side of the truck was now yanking on the leash trying to jump out of the left side of the bed.
74	9	We got out of there pretty quick.
75	0	I spend a lot of time on the road for work, so I have a lot of crazy stories.
75	1	I'll talk to anyone, so I meet a lot of interesting people.
75	2	This night is one of my favorites:
75	3	I was walking down the street in Sag Harbor, New York (the Hamptons).
75	4	I lit my cigarette and this guy asks me for a light.
75	5	He is dressed down, kinda rough looking.
75	6	We talk until we finish smoking, and he invites me into an expensive bar for a drink.
75	7	He buys me a $25 glass of cognac (only about 1/4-inch full), and introduces me to his wife and friend, some famous artist.
75	8	We have a few drinks and swap stories.
75	9	He had sailed his boat from Connecticut, and the water was too rough to return.
75	10	His son and daughter-in-law had to be back home for work the next morning, so he had his helicopter pick him up.
75	11	We all went to a haunted house, they smoked a bowl, and we returned to the bar.
75	12	Turns out this guy is a mobster and rich as fuck.
75	13	We go out for another cigarette, and a bus pulls up with three attractive women with baggage.
75	14	The mobster invites them in for drinks and tries to get me laid.
75	15	The hottest of the girls was shocked that I didn't know who she was.
75	16	She claimed to be an actress, so I asked what movie she was in.
75	17	She says "Money Talks".
75	18	I check IMDB, and she is not listed.
75	19	I then remember that there is a porn with the same title.
75	20	She was a porn-star.
75	21	I personally racked up a $1,200 bar-tab that night, all of which the mobster insisted in paying for.
75	22	I cabbed it back to the house I was staying at and called it a night.
75	23	I never heard back from any of the group.
76	0	Ok, I finally have a story to tell on Ask Reddit.
76	1	First off, fuck you for this thread, re telling this is probably going to give me nightmares tonight.
76	2	When I was about 10 we my family of six lived in an extremely small apartment.
76	3	2 bedrooms up stairs and then the livingroom.
76	4	When I was tired of my siblings I would sleep downstairs.
76	5	One night I am lying on the couch facing the front door and watching the sky through the window by the door when a face shows up in the window illuminated by a lighter.
76	6	I freeze, and the face goes away.
76	7	Im pretty relieved, thinking it was maybe our druggie neighbors seeing if my parents were still awake when it shows up again.
76	8	I try to scream but when I hope my mouth nothing came out, not a sound.
76	9	The person then kicks in the door and walks in the room, he sees me, smiles and goes towards the kitchen.
76	10	As he comes out of the kitchen with a knife my dad makes it down the stairs and the guy books it out of there.
76	11	I still cant sleep easily on couches to this day.
77	0	When I was around 12 my mom had picked me up from soccer practice and we went home.
77	1	I sat down on the couch and started playing on my phone.
77	2	About 5 minutes later I got bored and went upstairs to my room.
77	3	10 minutes later I hear my name called by who I thought was my dad.
77	4	I walk downstairs to 4 cops in my house.
77	5	My mom had forgotten I was in the house and thought I was a robber.
77	6	When she heard someone run up the stairs she ran outside, yelled for help, and called the cops.
77	7	When they asked if anyone else was inside it dawned on her that the "robber" was me.
78	0	Went camping with some friends on hill a few kilometers out in the woods from one of the guys house.
78	1	There's a few hiking/four wheeling trails in the area that lead up to the hill so it's known by the locals.
78	2	It was about midnight we had a fire going and were just sitting around having a good time, then the guy (there was 4 of us) sitting opposite of me yells who are you.
78	3	I turn around and there's this man, about 6ft tall staring at us from the edge of the woods with a big rock in his hand.
78	4	One guy knocked an arrow in the compound bow we had, the guy across from me grabbed the hatchet and I pulled the knife off my belt.
78	5	We had no clue what we were doing
78	6	but the guy wouldn't say anything to us.
78	7	He eventually just backed into the woods.
78	8	No sleep was had that night
78	9	and we kept a very large fire going.
79	0	In U.S. History class in high school, we we're learning about how America was like a "melting pot" of different cultures.
79	1	My teacher said that a better analogy of America is a "tossed salad" because of how different groups tended to cluster together ala Chinatown.
79	2	After the teacher said this, one girl spoke up and said "Oh, I get it.
79	3	A tossed salad is better because you can just pick out the things that you don't like.
79	4	" Everybody just looked at her for a minute.
79	5	She realized what she said a few seconds later and apologized profusely saying that is not what she meant.
80	0	Worst date I ever had, was actually like, my first date ever.
80	1	It was super awkward asking her out, but I told her, I'd never asked a girl out before.
80	2	We made the plans together and we were meeting up for lunch at a burger place.
80	3	I pay for the meal, we sit down and I begin to eat my food.
80	4	She barely eats anything, telling me she ate before hand.
80	5	You know....because when you're meeting someone for lunch you don't want to sit there eating with them.
80	6	She then talks about her job at starbucks, and how she spits in drinks and gives rude people who ask for decaf regular caffeinated coffee.
80	7	Other gross things like, picking her nose and putting it in the food and just, blech.
80	8	I was not laughing or in anyway acting interested in this topic.
80	9	She also decides to remind me, we will not be having sex.
80	10	This is my first date with a girl ever.
80	11	I told her this, she knows this.
80	12	Yet, she felt the need to say this.
80	13	As if some how I was giving her the signals that I needed to do her right then and there at this burger place?
80	14	She checks her phone multiple times, texts people and seems to be having a more interesting conversation with someone else.
80	15	She goes on about how ugly and fat she is.
80	16	Which she wasn't, I know some women do tend to have self-esteem issues.
80	17	I now know though, she did this in excess for a date.
80	18	I tried to tell her different, but I think she honestly lost respect me for me because I found her attractive.
80	19	She talks about how badly she wants to date some celebrity, idk who, we'll say Michael Cera for the hell of it.
80	20	How cute is, how she wants to marry him.
80	21	I'm just basically feeling like, I'm not in anyway talking to a real person.
80	22	Like, this seemed like the plot of a Kate Hudson movie or something.
80	23	I was pretty well convinced this was not going to work.
80	24	So, the date ends, and it actually was pretty short.
80	25	I think it was only an hour or so, but it felt like so much longer.
80	26	After that, she was still texting me and trying to go out with me, but I just couldn't.
80	27	This date only feels worse and worse each time I think of it.
80	28	As being my first date, I didn't think how bad it was till I went on more.
80	29	Then I realized what a horrible date she was being.
81	0	Alright this might get buried but whatever.. this is probably the closest I've come to getting into some REAL trouble.
81	1	Quite a few years back, a friend
81	2	and I had come into possession of several grams of dried 'magic' mushrooms, as well as a handful of LSD blotter tabs.
81	3	So we split it all between the two of us and prepared for a fun night.
81	4	Keep in mind by this time we were already both quite experienced with both substances, though this was the first time either of us had combined them.
81	5	So his girlfriend is driving us around town, we're just cruising along, I'm in the backseat.
81	6	It's winter so I'm wearing a big puffy green jacket, and as is my tradition while tripping, a pair of dark sunglasses, to hide the dilated pupils.
81	7	Several hours in and all is going great, we're having a ball, laughing our asses off and seeing some amazing things.
81	8	Anyway, all of a sudden, without any warning, I hit the peak of the trip.
81	9	Fireworks are exploding in my mind, I lose all ability to even string together a coherent sentence.
81	10	I'm just giggling to myself, totally lost in waves of bliss.
81	11	You get the picture.
81	12	Anyway, not long afterwards (I'm still riding the peak pretty hard), I realize that I need some water, so I ask our chauffeur to drive us to the nearest 24-hour convenience store - by now it's well after midnight.
81	13	She pulls up to the front door.
81	14	Since my mind is already so scrambled, I don't even think to ask her to go in for me, I just hop out of the truck and saunter in.
81	15	Now, from the shopkeeper's point-of-view, I was acting odd from the get-go.
81	16	I sort of drift in the front door, loopy grin on my face, eyes covered by dark sunglasses in the middle of the night.
81	17	I'm sort of drifting around the store aimlessly, hoping to eventually run into cooler where the bottled drinks are kept.
81	18	I'm so dazzled by the fluorescent lights and colorful packaging that I momentarily forget why I'm even in there.
81	19	AND, the whole time, my hand is buried in my back pocket - I had meant to grab my wallet, but once the hand was in there, I sort of forgot about it.
81	20	So, naturally, by the time I actually found the water and had returned to the counter to buy it, the poor clerk had assumed I was robbing the place.
81	21	There were several other employees in the building as well - it was a combination Subway-convenience store, so there were maybe three other people standing around.
81	22	I'm standing like a dope at the counter, still holding the water bottle in my hand, other hand still buried in my back pocket.
81	23	The clerk at the register won't make eye contact with me.
81	24	I keep trying to catch his attention, every time I look in his direction, he quickly glances away.
81	25	Same goes for every other employee - by now I'm starting to panic, this is a really surreal situation - and I keep trying to catch someone's gaze, but they all look away as soon as I look at them.
81	26	Everyone has a very frightened expression on their face, and I'm starting to pick up their fear and I get caught in this sort of feedback loop, until I'm as frightened as they are.
81	27	Finally my addled mind realizes what's going down, and in an attempt to diffuse the situation, I take off my sunglasses.
81	28	Unfortunately, this causes the store's brightness to jump up a couple notches, and thanks to my already extremely dilated pupils, I'm nearly blinded.
81	29	Nevertheless, I place the bottle on the counter, get my wallet out of my pocket, and place the debit card next to the water.
81	30	I forget exactly what I said, but I must have conveyed to the trembling clerk that I just want to make a purchase, and he slowly begins ringing it up.
81	31	Now I just want to get the hell out of there.
81	32	In between the dancing elves and multicolored fireworks, my mind is still piecing everything together, and I realize that he's probably pressed the hidden panic button by now.
81	33	But of course, I've also lost most motor skills in my hands, and I forget how to work a debit machine.
81	34	I can't even remember if I'm supposed to press 'checking' or 'savings', let alone my PIN number.
81	35	After staring furiously at the machine for a good half-minute, I finally let my hands just do it from memory, and somehow, they get it right.
81	36	I take my card, grab my water, and run.
81	37	I get into the truck and breathlessly tell my friends that we have to leave, NOW, because I'm convinced that the cops are gonna pull up any second.
81	38	My friend (the one that's also tripping), doesn't believe me, tells me I imagined the whole thing.
81	39	But his girlfriend saw pretty much everything through the window, saw how scared the employees looked, how they were all avoiding eye contact, etc, so she believes me and we take off into the night.
82	0	In line at 7-11 behind an elderly woman.
82	1	She pays for her things and leaves.
82	2	There's a banana sitting on the counter.
82	3	Cashier looks up and calls out "Miss, your banana," but she doesn't hear.
82	4	I bolt after her and catch up quickly, "Hey I think you left your banana inside.
82	5	"
82	6	She turns to me and glares.
82	7	"I didn't want the banana you little shit," and continues walking away.
83	0	My dad had this little toy monkey that he used to call his "favorite child" and tease me and my siblings with it.
83	1	Not in a bad way, but it was really frustrating to us and we spent hours trying to steal it from him.
83	2	Well anyways, one day we finally got it and threw it into the garbage after drawing on it and mangling it for a bit.
83	3	We My dad laughed and searched for it a bit but basically figured we had thrown it out and gave up after a week or so.
83	4	Anyways, a few years later (when I was about 17), I'm walking down the street in Toronto (I don't live in TO, was just visiting friends) and see this little orange object on the side of the road.
83	5	When I walk over to it, I pick it up and see that it was the EXACT SAME FUCKING MONKEY.
83	6	It even had the black sharpie lines on it from when we drew all over it.
83	7	I honestly cannot even come up with the chances of that happening, especially considering our garbage is sent to a local dump and is nowhere near Toronto.
84	0	Someone raped a female friend of mine, and she wouldn't go to the police about it.
84	1	(The guy was drunk and forced himself on her, she doesn't drink).
84	2	Caught the guy from behind one night by chance and beat and kicked the shit out of him, took his wallet, and left.
84	3	(Lived in a bad area at the time, a guy getting mugged late at night was nothing more than a statistic.
84	4	I figured a completely random beating might have drawn more attention).
84	5	I later found out that he'd done the same thing to at least one other woman.
84	6	I have zero regrets, beyond not thinking enough to aim for his genitals more.
84	7	I'm pretty sure I'd have a lot more trouble sleeping at night if I'd done nothing.
85	0	I was walking with my older brother one night- we were returning from a game he had.
85	1	It was probably 9-10 at the time, I was maybe 10.
85	2	For some perspective, I'm now 18 going on 19 in a month.
85	3	We were approaching the apartment building I live at, and we saw a figure.
85	4	He was probably the size of an average man.
85	5	Not surprisingly the darkness conceals his upper body, including his face.
85	6	We stop dead in our tracks.
85	7	Usually security guards patrol the grounds at this time, but their rounds start at 11.
85	8	This really shouldn't have scared us, but he started to run toward us.
85	9	Like, I mean SPRINT.
85	10	He was running really, really fast at us.
85	11	My older brother screamed at me to run.
85	12	He chased us for an entire length of a street, until my older brother told me to go under a fence that is arching above the ground, perfect for our sizes.
85	13	We were scared shitless as we saw him try to climb over the fence, but luckily we were very close to home.
85	14	A week later, we found out that a child went missing the night after we escaped.
85	15	To this day, the child was never found.
85	16	TL:DR:
85	17	My older brother and I were almost nabbed by a potential kidnapper.
85	18	Barely escaped.
86	0	One time, I was standing at a pedestrian crossing waiting for the light to turn green.
86	1	There's a small girl and her mother beside me.
86	2	I take little notice of them as they are minding their own business.
86	3	The small girl takes a step forward, into the traffic, which he mother fails to notice.
86	4	She was probably trying to get a closer look at something on the road, I don't know.
86	5	Anyway, her mother doesn't notice the imminent danger she has let her daughter put herself into, and I reach out and grab the daughter literally centimeters before she gets hit by a car.
86	6	The mother thinks I'm some kind of pedophile and starts screaming and making a scene, saying she hopes I burn in hell etc.
86	7	People nearby start reacting and threatening to call the cops and other various insults.
86	8	I just leave the situation immediately.
86	9	Seriously, fuck that bitch.
87	0	After moose hunting last year, my father brought me to investigate a black bear den.
87	1	Earlier in the day, he had gone to closely inspect the den solo.
87	2	Mind you, this was after watching the bear walk about 2 km/1 mile away into a clear cut (recently forested area).
87	3	When we arrived there it was roughly 4:30pm, and my father hadn't seen the bear in that area for about six hours.
87	4	With confidence, we approached the den.
87	5	It's amazing how complacency can turn a serene moment into a terrifying one.
87	6	My father had his rifle in an 'at-the-ready' over his waist, while mine was still lazily slung behind my shoulder.
87	7	My father looked into the den opening from about five feet away, and I thought he said "You can see him right in there.
87	8	*insert slight grin*.
87	9	" He did not say the word "him" in that sentence.
87	10	I moved to where my father was standing and leered into the den, while he did a quick binocular-scan of the horizon for any moose/wildlife.
87	11	What looked out of the den at me were two bright yellow-brown eyes, and a soft snout.
87	12	You may be thinking "SO WHY THE FUCK WERE YOU STILL THERE?
87	13	", but what you have to realize is that my father is one of the most sterotypical Canadians you'll meet.
87	14	Anything nature related is his area of expertise, and this fact gave me a false sense of security.
87	15	I casually turn away from the den to follow my father back to our respective posts, and this is the moment when the Pretty Eyed pooh-bear decided it should leave the den.
87	16	Black bears make this thunderous noise by slamming all their weight onto their front paws, in an attempt at intimidation.
87	17	This noise was indeed intimidating, as well as the first moment that clued my father in to the bear's presence.
87	18	While I was still turning around, my father had his rifle drawn and ready to fire should it advance any closer.
87	19	5 feet is what separated the two of us from this beast.
87	20	It only took about two seconds for the bear to turn and run full speed in the opposite directions, but I felt every primal instinct kick in during that period.
87	21	As if somebody had just sneezed, my father asked "You ok?
87	22	" then casually started to walk back towards his post.
88	0	We had a small wedding (40 people) at my grandparents house in the country.
88	1	No wedding party, just me and my Dad walking down the aisle to my (now) husband and the minister.
88	2	I sent an email out to my immediate family saying dress casual and comfortable but bearing in mind that pictures would be taken so at least shower and run a comb through your hair.
88	3	The day before the wedding when we were checking in to the hotel
88	4	my I walk by my aunt and cousins.
88	5	I see my 10 year old cousins dress.
88	6	It's almost an exact copy of my wedding dress.
88	7	I didn't say anything right then because I was having several crisis' due to the caterer not providing tables for food like I thought she would.
88	8	My mistake - should have asked and got it out in the air.
88	9	I don't like be confrontational.
88	10	I thought it was tacky and pretty self centered of my aunt for letting my cousin get away with this.
88	11	I showed my aunt and cousin my dress 6 months before the wedding.
88	12	They waited until the weekend before and didn't want to show me so it could be "a surprise".
88	13	I spent a lot of time on my dress and it's the one day of my life that wasn't about my aunt or cousin.
88	14	So I said something.
88	15	What erupted was WWIII.
88	16	About how I was going to be divorced within the month.
88	17	About how I was going to fall into a loveless marriage and end up with a roommate and not a husband.
88	18	How I was crazy for trying to take away something so special from a 10 year old little girl.
88	19	Projecting much Auntie?
88	20	Crazy bitches all around - me included - but seriously.
89	0	I was driving on some country roads at 1a.m.
89	1	with my buddy one night in the summer.
89	2	Come up to a one lane, old, rickety bridge at the bottom of a valley.
89	3	The bridge is also next to an old bar that now sits abandoned and is frequently vandalized, so it's already sketchy.
89	4	Pull onto the bridge and there is a car waiting on the other side...
89	5	At first we thought nothing of it.
89	6	If a car is on the bridge you have to sit there and wait your turn to cross.
89	7	But here's where it gets sPoOkY...
89	8	My friend and I get closer and closer to the car, but something is wrong.
89	9	We see a white glove waving at us at about half-way to the other side.
89	10	As we are almost across the bridge we see that the person waving his white glove has an expressionless mask on...
89	11	Needless to say, we freak the foooook out as we have to slowly weave around the car and stare face to face with the person still waving.
89	12	Drive off, scared shitless, but have to take the same road back...
89	13	We get to the bottom of the hill, car is still there, but there is no one inside.
89	14	We kinda look around for a second before we gtfo of there and we haven't been back since.
89	15	Fuck expressionless masks, man.
90	0	In college, I had to write a story about the Pelops, an ancient Greek who started the Olympics (as one myth tells it).
90	1	I get to studying, there's not much on Wikipedia, but I find some good books and get the job done.
90	2	A week after turning in the paper, I get an email from the professor saying I plagiarized the whole thing off Wikipedia.
90	3	The thing was I had updated the Wikipedia page and was caught plagiarizing myself.
90	4	I just showed him my work and was let off the hook
91	0	Not quite the same thing, but it was a good deed done for my mom that our family wished hadn't been done.
91	1	My parents ate lunch at Applebees a few years back, and my mom left her purse at the table.
91	2	They don't realize it til they get home (a half hour later), but when they do, my dad calls the Applebees to see if someone had turned it in.
91	3	They said no, so my dad called my mom's cell, hoping someone would hear it ringing under the table.
91	4	It rang twice, with no answer, but was answered the third time.
91	5	The following conversation ensued:
91	6	**Dad**: Hello?
91	7	This is my wife's phone.
91	8	She left her purse at Applebees.
91	9	**Elderly man**:
91	10	Oh, yes.
91	11	I found it a little while ago and brought it home.
91	12	You can come pick it up at *address*.
91	13	**Dad**: OK, I'll be by soon.
91	14	But why didn't you just turn it in to the management?
91	15	**Elderly man**: Well, there's a lot of them colored folks working there, and I just didn't feel safe leaving it with them.
91	16	You can't really trust them around money, you know.
91	17	Yes, by the way, I'm from Mississippi.
92	0	I helped 2 guys out of a crushed car, putting my life in danger as gas was spilling.
92	1	They ran away as soon as I got them out.
92	2	Turns out the car was stolen and the police were on to them.
92	3	The cops found me on top of the car holding the door open and arrested me.
92	4	Spent the night in jail for that good deed.
92	5	Another time I worked in a restaurant at the beach.
92	6	As I was closing I see a child wondering around crying.
92	7	I abandoned my work and stayed with her for 4 hours or something, calling the cops, trying out numbers she things she remembers etc.
92	8	When the cops and the parents finally come they start interrogating me like I kidnapped her or something.
92	9	After some time I got angry and started shouting and they just told me to go away.
92	10	Not even a thank you or anything.
92	11	Another time a guy in front of me at the ATM machine left a full wallet on the machine and walked away.
92	12	I was not paying attention to him so I didnt even notice what he was wearing.
92	13	So I took the wallet into the bank and explained at the counter what happened.
92	14	There is a wad of cash in there.
92	15	I say I have to leave but was asked politely at first that I have to stay until they contact the owner.
92	16	I say I have to leave I had something important to do.
92	17	Instead the security guys detain me for like 30 minutes until the owner shows up.
92	18	He says everything in there, I am just standing there nobody told him that I found it, they just told me you can leave now.
92	19	I had dreadlocks all these times and my skin colour is of the darker kind, maybe played a roll maybe not.
92	20	I just continue doing good when I can and most of the times it is appreciated.
93	0	One thing that still gets me angry untill this very day.
93	1	A few years ago, a friend of my wife got into some trouble.
93	2	She had moved away with her boyfriend and got homesick, didnt know how to handle her relationship and cheated on her boyfriend with a real dickhead.
93	3	She kinda got kicked out to straighten up her act, but her boyfriend stood by her (unbelievable, but true), telling her to come back when she worked things out.
93	4	She had no job, no home and her parents wouldn't take her in.
93	5	Now this is especially important.
93	6	We had two little kids at the time, one was still a baby, but my wife felt sorry for her and we took her in.
93	7	We have a big house and she got a floor to herself.
93	8	Now she didn't pay rent, didn't pay for food and we helped her get therapy and get her life straight.
93	9	I helped her get a job, she got back with her boyfriend (who stayed at our house while he was in town in the weekends).
93	10	It took about 10 months and she got back with her boyfriend, all was well.
93	11	Fast forward a few years, my wife is pregnant with our third child and we just heard that he was handicapped, we just didn't know what it was yet.
93	12	Meanwhile the friend had called us, but since we were at the hospital all the time, we hadn't returned her calls.
93	13	Having a big family, we had to explain a lot of things to a lot of people and we were fucking tired.
93	14	Then we got an e-mail from her, saying she felt we were being distant and she was disappointed with us.
93	15	So, we answered in short that we were sorry to disappoint her, but we had been very busy.
93	16	We'd make it up.
93	17	Next thing you know, we get all kinds of e-mail accusing us of being rotten friends and now that she was having a family of her own, she didn't have time in her life for people that weren't there for her.
93	18	My wife wrote an e-mail back, explaining everything and even pointing out that we had put our lives on hold for her, even though we had kids of our own and we had finacially supported her for almost a year while she was depressed and unemployed, left alone by her own parents.
93	19	She let me read it, but I told her to change it into:
93	20	Dear (..),
93	21	We wish you the best, have a nice life.
93	22	Sincerely,
93	23	We decided that this was more than enough for her.
94	0	A few years back I rented an apartment from a friend of mine.
94	1	He had recently bought it and had it completely renovated.
94	2	He put it up for sale but couldn't find a buyer so I offered to rent it in the meantime.
94	3	After moving in I realized there was something wrong with the lady next door.
94	4	She was about 45 but looked much older.
94	5	She would sit up all night listening to Christian radio shows and talking loudly to someone.
94	6	It got to the point where I couldn't sleep so I went over to her place and asked her to keep it down.
94	7	She opened her door and I got a quick peak.
94	8	Her walks all had crosses painted on them in different colors.
94	9	And words like "Jesus" and "angels" scribbled everywhere.
94	10	The windows were painted black letting no light in at all.
94	11	It was damp, yellow stained 50 year old carpets, dog shit and cock roaches everywhere.
94	12	No dog though.
94	13	I asked her to please keep it down.
94	14	She just looked at me and shut the door.
94	15	Then she turned up the radio even louder.
94	16	The next night I had my GF staying over.
94	17	I wake up in the middle of the night and see a shadow of a person next to the bed looking at us sleeping.
94	18	I think I'm hallucinating as I usually do in the dark when I'm sleepy.
94	19	But then the shadow starts talking.
94	20	It's my neighbor and she's holding something in her hand.
94	21	She broke in during the night and who knows how long she stood there.
94	22	"You should lock your door at night" she says and walks out.
94	23	The next morning I hear someone making strange noises below my bedroom window.
94	24	It's my neighbor talking to herself in tongue.
94	25	She has a plastic bag in her hand with her rotting dead dog inside.
94	26	It's hot as hell outside and I can smell death from the bag.
94	27	At this point I'm scared shitless.
94	28	Shes obviously very insane.
94	29	I go upstairs and knock on another persons door and ask what the hell is going on.
94	30	The guy is as scared as me.
94	31	Apparently she broke into his apartment one evening as well while he was watching tv with his kids.
94	32	He got up from the couch to get a snack only to find her behind the couch staring at him holding a power drill.
94	33	(Now I know what was in her hand)
94	34	At this stage I'm basically pooping myself.
94	35	I call the cops and they know all about her.
94	36	Apparently she is a violent schizzo and she hasn't taken her meds.
94	37	But they can't force her or enter her apartment w/o her permission because she owns it.
94	38	The only thing they can do is get her when she goes outside.
94	39	I sit up for the next two days waiting for her to run out of cigarettes.
94	40	When I hear her leave at 2am to go across the road to the 7-eleven I call the cops.
94	41	They have 3 cars and a special van over in less than 2 minutes.
94	42	They restrain her and throw her in the van and drive off to some institution and in less than a minute it's like she was never there.
94	43	I never see her again.
94	44	Still have nightmares about her looking at me in my sleep.
95	0	I posted this story on another thread, but it is relevant here.
95	1	In highschool I get my first girlfriend, I was 15 and she was 14.
95	2	Things go pretty good, we get together pretty quickly, soon after we start dating we lose our virginity to each other.
95	3	It turns out, 8 months into the relationship, that she has a best friend who has a huge crush on her, and she has a huge crush on him.
95	4	She decides to break up with me to be with him for a while.
95	5	Being in the same school I got to see her everyday, and we would still make out constantly, apparently her best friend was Ok with having an open relationship.
95	6	After a week or two, she starts to get really quiet and nervous around me.
95	7	It turns out the best friend was abusing her, she came one day with bruises on her neck where he was holding her while he raped her.
95	8	This goes on for a while, I give her all the support I can (as I was still in love with her) and try to get back together.
95	9	Finally she breaks up with the dude, and comes back with me.
95	10	From that point on the relationship went pretty much downhill, she got colder and colder as I grew tired of being emotionally manipulated to stay with her, we finally break up.
95	11	After breaking up, she is the sweetheart she was at the beggining, and was around me all the time trying to make out with me.
95	12	For the first weeks I'm ok with it, but slowly she starts getting colder again, so I back off and get out.
95	13	After a while I see her get so lonely I start getting woried and try to be her friend.
95	14	Then she misses school for a week.
95	15	I call her parents and family and everybody refuses to let me talk to her or to tell me what's going on.
95	16	Turns out she tried to kill herself, and was admited to a psychiatric hospital, normal procedure after an atempted suicide.
95	17	She comes back to school and tells me she was diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolarity and borderline.
95	18	Plot twist, it turns out the best friend was part of her schizophrenia and never really existed.
96	0	So, this one time I was cruising with a fully loaded merchant ship, I was a smuggler you see...
96	1	As I was enjoying my exploits, my crew and I came upon a castle under siege.
96	2	Without knowing any better I made he decision to land our cog on the shores of Storm's End.
96	3	When I finally made it inside I met this stern fellow named Stannis.
96	4	He told me how he had been holding the castle without food for weeks.
96	5	First they ate the horses, then they ate the dogs, cats after them, then the rats.
96	6	Being the classy fellow I am, I offer all the food in my merchant cog, including a large amount of onions.
96	7	Because of my generous offering, the men defending Storm's End lived to fight another day, and eventually held off their enemies.
96	8	For my courageous act I was awarded a knighthood, and land of my own.
96	9	Just as I was settling into my new title, I was approached by Stannis, the Lord of Storm's End, "One right doesn't erase a wrong..."
96	10	He shortened my right hand by removing 4 of my knuckles, as a punishment for smuggling.
96	11	I am Davos Seaworth, the Onion Knight, AMA.
97	0	I was playing tennis with some friends, and a woman and her kids (around 4 years old or so) walked by with their new puppy.
97	1	Puppy got loose, got hit by a car, and ran away.
97	2	My friends and I saw this, dropped our racquets, and ran after the puppy as it sprinted through the apartment complex, while the mother stood there and wigged the fuck out.
97	3	The 4 of us combined probably covered a mile and half with all of the running (scared puppy didn't realize how tired or hurt it was, I think), and we finally cornered it in some brush.
97	4	I climbed down a hill through the brush, and we took the dog back to it's very excited owners.
97	5	I got covered in poison ivy from crawling through the brush.
98	0	My dad told me this story once of how my grandpa knew a guy (I'll call him Bob) that used to work at Area 51.
98	1	He never said anything about it tho because it was "against regulation".
98	2	Anyway, one night Bob and my grandpa are at a bar getting wasted and such and Bob starts talking about Area 51, which was a first.
98	3	He goes on about the creatures and aliens and ufos in there.
98	4	About the experiments and such.
98	5	My grandpa didn't really pay much attention to it.
98	6	At the end of their drinking and confession session they part their ways, planning on meeting up at the bar later that week again.
98	7	This is the weird part.
98	8	My grandpa is waiting for his bud at the bar later that week.
98	9	And he doesn't show.
98	10	He tries calling and getting a hold of him later.
98	11	But nothing.
98	12	He never hears from him again.
98	13	No one had after that night he went off about Area 51.
99	0	Really long story kinda short - threw almost every piece of furniture out of a 7th floor hotel room window (in an attempt to hide evidence of a vodka orgy gone wrong from the adults who were responsible for our tour group) on the last night of a student exchange trip to Moscow.
99	1	Had to pack everything I hadn't tossed out the window in less than a minute, then "fake left / run right" to escape the room with my bag after the maid/babushka's angry shouting woke me up a few hours later.
99	2	Immediately boarded a bus to the airport and left the country; never heard anything about it.
100	0	This is my true horror story.
100	1	Getting stuck in a tiny space with your arms pinned at your sides and not being able to move and just feeling helpless.
100	2	I lived that.
100	3	Being a little kid and adventuring there was this big pipe sticking out of the ground.
100	4	Nobody was around and I climbed in head first and slid down until my head hit the ground inside the pipe.
100	5	I thought I was gonna die there and I just started crying and crying and I prayed so hard until after a while I heard my Dad screaming my name and I screamed as loud as I could but he couldn't hear me.
100	6	He saw me playing around there earlier and happened to climb up on the shed with the ladder I used and looked in the pipe and saw my feet.
100	7	He immediately grabbed me and pulled me out with me bawling my eyes out.
100	8	I had nightmares about that for weeks after and I still do have nightmares about it to this day.
100	9	Lesson learned, kids.
100	10	Don't do stupid crap.
101	0	I had a monkey on my key chain back in high school.
101	1	This chain was three links long.
101	2	One day I was walking out to my car and I heard something hit the ground.
101	3	I looked down to discover the monkey with links one and two of the chain still attached on the ground and link three still attached to my belt.
101	4	All of the links were still fused together, my only guess is the chain phased itself apart.
102	0	My mom found a computer on the playground of the school she works at.
102	1	It was obviously stolen from some kids.
102	2	They could not log in to the machine due to the windows login screen so they ditched it on the playground.
102	3	My mom gave it to me to see if I could manage to get in and see who it belonged to.
102	4	I managed to circumvent the windows login screen using some linux usb boot method (I forget the name of the program).
102	5	Anyway I managed to locate the owners email from the computer and it turned out it was a lady who worked at a church.
102	6	I arranged to meet her at her church to return her laptop.
102	7	Upon arrival I was brought into a room with the woman, the head priest and some other people.
102	8	She as well as the rest of them accused me of stealing the laptop and that it was god's intervention which made me realize my mistake and want to return the laptop.
102	9	They all looked at me and really believed this is what happened.
102	10	It still makes me mad thinking about it today.
103	0	When I was about 8 years old I went to a large indoor water park with my sister.
103	1	There was one particular long tube-like slide where a guy at the bottom would signal the guy at the top to let the next kid through.
103	2	So I'm at the top waiting...my sister is in line behind me.
103	3	The guy waves me to go, I go in
103	4	but I don't really know how to get a good momentum.
103	5	I'm sitting up and not going anywhere, basically half-way through the tube.
103	6	Little did I know I was supposed to lean back, hands folded in front of my chest, feet raised slightly...
103	7	(learned that later)
103	8	So I'm just sitting there basically dead in the water and I look back...there is my sister barreling down towards me.
103	9	I turned back, closed my eyes and braced for impact.
103	10	At the last second, miraculously she swished around me and was gone.
103	11	I sat there for another few seconds, blinking, not believing what just happened.
103	12	Then I realized how she was doing it...
103	13	I leaned back, folded my arms
103	14	and I started to slide.
103	15	I made it to the bottom without further incident.
103	16	My sis was so excited and babbling a mile a minute **"I almost smashed into you!!
103	17	Wow!
103	18	That was lucky!
103	19	**
104	0	When I was 14 years old, I was in an awkward place in life.
104	1	I was an aspie, a tomboy, and my only good friends were for some reason extroverted fashionistas.
104	2	One was a guy...he'd been my video game buddy for years but when he came out of the closet, he transformed into a total douche that let me know DAILY that I looked like a lesbian hobo.
104	3	The other was a girl I had been best friends with since first grade, and she decided one day that I was holding her back with my apparent disregard for social norms.
104	4	She just stopped being friends with me.
104	5	I was lonely, depressed, and self-loathing.
104	6	So that's the set up.
104	7	On some AOL video game message boards, there was this girl.
104	8	Her screenname was Samui.
104	9	I had a girl-crush, I guess.
104	10	She was tomboyish like me, but cool about it, and funny as hell.
104	11	Everyone loved her, and I wanted to be her, or at least as cool as her.
104	12	Que Aspherger's syndrome: My response to this was to make up some cool people to be my friends so that people would think I was cool, too.
104	13	It made sense at the time.
104	14	However, it got WAY out of hand.
104	15	I carried the facade into my real life.
104	16	I told stories about these people.
104	17	They had families, hometowns, friends of their own.
104	18	A few had myspaces.
104	19	I found out that I am one *fantastic* liar.
104	20	People believed me.
104	21	Some of my friends developed their own friendships with them and chatted online all the time.
104	22	One friend from school even bitched about me to one of them...that's when I got jealous.
104	23	**I was jealous of my own imaginary friends.
104	24	**
104	25	What happened?
104	26	They were cooler than me!
104	27	They were getting invited to things that I wasn't!
104	28	Also, at about this point, I fucked up bigtime and started "dating" one of them that "lived in Yorktown.
104	29	" He was very popular.
104	30	Remember that girl who ditched me for not being cool enough?
104	31	**She told me to fuck off because she liked him.
104	32	** She'd been talking to him with a sceenname that was different from her old one!
104	33	I was about to be in my first girl drama!
104	34	As proud as I was, HE WASN'T REAL!
104	35	Fuck!
104	36	So, time to fix things.
104	37	I'm a writer, granted a young one at the time, but I had skills.
104	38	One imaginary friend commits suicide.
104	39	Everyone buys it, he'd been struggling with depression anyway since he'd been living with his brother after their parents' car accident.
104	40	Tears were shed, my own parents ask if I want therapy.
104	41	I bravely decline.
104	42	One by one, I literally wrote these people out of my life.
104	43	A couple of the fabrications who were old enough to enlist supposedly did that...I live in a navy area so that wasn't weird to anyone, either.
104	44	It was hard work.
104	45	I had to do tread carefully so as to not be found out.
104	46	Becoming known as the craziest fucking liar to ever live was not something I wanted to do.
104	47	I am 21 years old now, and people still ask me how so-and-so is doing.
104	48	Please, please understand that I feel guilt to this day over this.
104	49	When it started, I was just lonely.
104	50	And weirdly enough, making up stories and keeping up with lies helped me learn how people work.
104	51	I practically cured my fucking Aspergers with this.
104	52	I REGRET NOTHING!
104	53	Okay, I regret it a little.
104	54	That is so messed up.
104	55	Young me was batshit crazy.
105	0	Oh man, I have one of these that INVOLVES the Matrix.
105	1	I got my wisdom teeth out in 2000 right around the time that the original Matrix came out on VHS.
105	2	I was bombed completely out of my mind on percocet after coming back from the surgery (I had awful wisdom teeth), and my mom basically just dropped me in bed and went and rented the movie for me because I'd never seen it in theaters.
105	3	I remember being irritated that the sun through the window was making the TV glare but being too out of it to get up.
105	4	A little bit after the black cat glich in the matrix scene, I passed out and apparently slept for about eight hours.
105	5	The tape in the VHS machine kept rewinding itself and playing over and over again.
105	6	I woke up and the movie was at roughly the same spot as when I passed out, but it was completely dark outside.
105	7	Zero time lapse for me.
105	8	Completely lost my mind.
105	9	Started freaking out and screaming because I thought I'd discovered the secret and somebody turned off the sun.
105	10	I remember crying and trying to explain to my panicked family, who have never let me live it down.
106	0	Want one worse?
106	1	As a youngling, (somewhere Kindergarten or 1st grade) I attended a rather large easter-egg hunt.
106	2	This was put on by a group with some decent funding, so some of the eggs had prizes you'd get for finding them.
106	3	I spot one in a tree and climb my little ass up there to retrieve it.
106	4	When I get down and crack it, the prize is a fucking remote control plane.
106	5	*YES YES YES*
106	6	I think, and say, as I run over to turn it in.
106	7	As I hand the lady the slip, she tells me "this is a big kids toy, I can't give it to you", and she gives the plane to her son.
106	8	I didn't even get a replacement toy of any kind, and because I had to run from all the way across the field, I missed out on prime egg-hunting time to find something else.
106	9	In the end it was the only egg I pulled, because I saw it in a great hiding place, and I made a bee-line for it while disregarding the lesser, more obvious, eggs.
107	0	In 1984 my grandmother gave me a Fisher Price playset featuring a boat and trailer, a diver, a jeep, and a translucent plastic octopus.
107	1	I took it to a beach, (in a calm bay), and lost the octopus in the water a few yards down the beach from where my family was staying that summer.
107	2	Three years later I found the plastic octopus in the water buried under some sand right behind the place we were staying.
107	3	It even had a barnacle on it.
108	0	There's a story in my family that is referred to as The Poo Sock.
108	1	I was about 10 years old and I lived with my mom, little brother, stepdad, two older stepbrothers, and my stepdad's dad.
108	2	One day I went to the bathroom and took a shit.
108	3	There was no toilet paper.
108	4	I had no idea what to do.
108	5	I spent about 20min hollering for someone to help me but no one was home.
108	6	Then I saw the sock.
108	7	I didn't know whose sock it was, all I knew was that I could wipe my ass with it, so I did.
108	8	I then stared horrified at the sock.
108	9	*What had I done?
108	10	*
108	11	The only thing I could think of was to get rid of the sock.
108	12	I don't know why I did it, but I hid it behind the toilet.
108	13	Maybe I heard someone get home or maybe I was just terrified, I don't know all I know is I did it.
108	14	Then I washed my hands and left.
108	15	The plan was to return to the scene of the crime in the dead of night while everyone was sleeping and throw out the sock in the construction down the block where they had just knocked down a grain silo.
108	16	No one would ever know.
108	17	Then my mom found the sock.
108	18	That day.
108	19	Before I'd even had a chance to get rid of it.
108	20	My brother, stepbrothers, and I were sat around the table and then *bam*
108	21	The Poo Sock was tossed down in the center of the table (on something, not directly on the table, I think it was on a plastic bag or something).
108	22	I froze.
108	23	I was so horrified that I'd been found out.
108	24	My oldest stepbrother was 13 at the time was disgusted.
108	25	He made everyone know how he felt and became angered that he was brought into the situation since it was such a disgusting thing to do.
108	26	My other stepbrother, 11, and my little brother, 9, were laughing uncontrollably.
108	27	I'm talking barely able to breathe with tears running down your face laughter.
108	28	There was a shit covered sock on the table and it was comedy gold.
108	29	I stared in disbelief at the sock.
108	30	I was sure they were going to call me out on it.
108	31	After the initial lecture my mom and stepdad apparently decided to go about the ordeal in a rational thinking kind of way.
108	32	Who was the least likely person to have wiped their ass with a sock and then shove it behind a toilet?
108	33	Not the girl.
108	34	I was let off the hook.
108	35	Soon, my oldest stepbrother joined me.
108	36	The others remained.
108	37	It had been over an hour of parents yelling and they *still had not stopped laughing*.
108	38	Laughter was equal to guilt, but the problem was that there were two of them laughing.
108	39	Eventually my parents gave up and released them.
108	40	The sock was thrown out.
108	41	It was generally agreed upon that it must have been the elderly gentleman living with us.
108	42	No one was going to confront him, that man had had 26 strokes while diving into a pool and was still able to take care of himself!
108	43	Let him wipe his damn ass with a sock.
108	44	It's been a decade.
108	45	No one knows.
109	0	It's nowhere near as bad as some in here, but I regularly try to feed meters around me if I see they're expiring.
109	1	One day I was walking to my car when I saw the meter maid a few cars down.
109	2	I looked at the meter next to me, so I filled it, then walked around and started getting into my car.
109	3	The guy yelled over and asked if that was my meter.
109	4	I told him it wasn't, as I was basically in my car trying to leave, and he told me to stop and wrote me a $50 ticket.
109	5	Ugh.
110	0	I was on a wildfire just south of Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah.
110	1	We were in fire rigs driving to the incident area, four trucks in close convoy, when we heard helicopters.
110	2	Eight black military choppers escorted us in formation for like ten miles, we assumed they were just doing drills and using us for fake target practice or something.
110	3	A little while later we are parked and about to start hiking to the fire line when suddenly a thin column of smoke shoots probably about two hundred feet into the sky, it was a good mile away but the concussion was pretty significant when it hit us and the noise was still ridiculously loud.
110	4	We thought it was probably no big deal, we knew we were near a strike zone.
110	5	A good five minutes later an aircraft like nothing I have ever seen flew by us at maybe five hundred feet.
110	6	It was flat black and sort of rectangular but with fins and wells on the underside.
110	7	It was moving pretty slow and was dead silent so I have to assume it was some sort of stealth glider.
110	8	It sounds ridiculous but it immediately reminded me of a huge, flying bat mobile, Time Burton era.
110	9	After that some military personnel got on our radio frequency and instructed us to leave the area immediately, when our crew chief asked who it was and why they signed off and the Incident Commander (the guy in charge of managing the entire situation) came on the radios and said we were evacuating the area.
110	10	They sent us to a completely different fire about a hundred miles to the south and never told us why except that it was higher priority which was bullshit, it was already out when we got there and we just assisted crews in the mop up operation.
110	11	The thing that confuses me about this is that if the army didn't want us to see that shit or if it was dangerous why didn't they keep us clear of the area in the first place?
110	12	Either a communications breakdown or they had a now shit situation going down and had to get us out of there without warning.
111	0	One day in high school, my mom corners me in my room holding up this small white thing.
111	1	She's got this frantic look on her face and is yelling "What is this!?!
111	2	Springislikeaperhaps, *what is this*?
111	3	"
111	4	I calmly reply, "Mom, that's a Tic Tac.
111	5	"
111	6	We were reminiscing about that story the other day.
111	7	Apparently she had found it on the floor of my room and consulted my father (a pharmacist) and he couldn't identify what they both though was a pill.
111	8	This somehow convinced her that I was on drugs.
111	9	I've never done drugs in my life.
112	0	It was my first time in Holt Renfrew (a super-expensive, chi-chi store) and I had to use the ladies' room.
112	1	The whole bathroom was very elegant and nicely decorated.
112	2	In the stall they even had a lady's handbag hanging from one of the hooks as decor.
112	3	Or so I thought.
112	4	Until I realized another customer had forgotten their Christian Dior handbag in the stall.
112	5	I took it off the hook and was going to take it to see if there was a lost and found, or someone who could help me find the owner.
112	6	Right then, a frantic lady in her high heels and couture rushes into the washroom looking for her handbag, sees me with it, snatches it right out of my hands and yells at me for "trying to steal it.
112	7	"
113	0	Not sure if this relates, but..
113	1	About two years into my relationship with my GF (we'll call her Susan), I had a dream about my ex.
113	2	Dream went like this:
113	3	I was in my room (at my mother's house, where I lived at the time) slamming my ex.
113	4	Balls to the wall sexing it up.
113	5	I knew I was cheating on Susan, but didn't care.
113	6	So in the middle of it, I look over to the window (which you can see the back porch from) and Susan is there, watching us, crying and mortified.
113	7	I then woke up.
113	8	I thought it was a weird dream, but dismissed it.
113	9	A few days go by and Susan and I are hanging out in my room.
113	10	She brings up this weird dream she had a few days prior, and describes *my exact dream* except from her POV looking through the window.
113	11	Freaked me the fuck out, didn't say anything about it at the time.
113	12	I still haven't said anything (five or six years later).
113	13	It still weirds me out.
114	0	So I was sitting on my front porch with this girl who lived down the block.
114	1	We were hooking up after I had recently broken up with my psychotic drug addicted ex girlfriend for cheating on me.
114	2	So this silver car rolls by that I recognize as her (the ex's) friends vehicle, and WHILE ITS ROLLING BY MY HOUSE the back door opens up and out rolls my screaming crying psycho ex.
114	3	The bitch hits the concret at 10 mph and then jumps up with a baseball bat and starts screaming that shes gonna kill the other chick.
114	4	I put the other girl in my house and tried to calm her down.
114	5	Only a threat of a police call got her to leave.
115	0	One time, I was in Vegas and on the way back to my room I realized that I didn't have my phone!
115	1	I had my friend call it and some guy answered.
115	2	He said he was in the casino of our hotel so we went down to meet him.
115	3	We met up with him, and I started screaming at him about how he had stolen my phone!
115	4	Oh wait, no, I didn't because I'm not a crazy bitch.
115	5	I thanked him profusely and went on my merry way.
115	6	I was at a tennis tournament last summer and I got out of my seat to go get a refreshing beverage.
115	7	Some kid walked up to me as I was paying for my drink and handed me my phone which I didn't know had even been gone.
115	8	Again, I threatened to call the cops on him because he had obviously stolen it.
115	9	Oh no, I thanked the kid for being a good citizen.
115	10	People are crazy.
115	11	And I lose my phone a lot.
116	0	This'll probably get buried, but what the hell?
116	1	I was working at a lesser-known Coffee shop when I saw that someone had left his wallet on the seat (I was cleaning the lobby when I'd noticed it.
116	2	)
116	3	He'd driven off, but the drive-thru gave me access to hang half my body out the window and hold up/wave his wallet in the air.
116	4	He noticed and immediately flung his car around, making a loud screech, he parked in our drive-thru and stormed into the store.
116	5	Immediately he began shouting (He's about 6', so he's got my attention) and accusing me of stealing the wallet.
116	6	Much like in OP's story, accused me of stealing money and when I revealed that I had no money, he accused me of stealing it and then putting it into the tip jars.
116	7	He reaches his mitt into our tip jar and grabs the (few) bills we have.
116	8	I stand in front of him and, very sternly, explain to him that that money belongs to myself and my coworker, and that if he did not leave, we would call the police.
116	9	My goal was to just walk away, but it got a bit heated...
116	10	I'm 6'2", but I've got very long hair.
116	11	I kept it in a ponytail, which he yanked just hard enough to get a tear-jerk reaction from me.
116	12	Before I know what's happening, I'm turning around
116	13	and I punch him in the nose.
116	14	He retaliates, punching me in the nose and, by now, my coworker has called the police.
116	15	The store was located less than a mile from the county court/police building, so there were policemen there at the scene.
116	16	During the 2-3 minutes it took, I hopped behind the counter to avoid this guy and to wipe up some of the blood from my nose.
116	17	He'd taken to screaming in the empty store while smashing a mug every few seconds, or throwing a tumbler.
116	18	The entire store looked like it had been struck by a tornado.
116	19	Unfortunately, this story doesn't have a happy ending, either.
116	20	He didn't choose to sue me (I would've counter-sued), but rather the establishment.
116	21	The rule was that the case would be dropped if I was fired, and my employer agreed to this.
116	22	I lost my job.
116	23	Less-sad part?
116	24	I had another job, which I allocated more hours to, which ended up making FAR more money than the coffee shop job.
116	25	I do not know/care/want to know what happened to that coffee shop, and if they sued for damages, or anything.
117	0	I was driving along in my car a few years ago.
117	1	Broad daylight.
117	2	Eastern New Mexico.
117	3	It was a clear sunny day, but I could see a spherical light in the sky in the distance.
117	4	It looked like a chrome sphere.
117	5	It hovered there for 20 minutes or - seemingly pacing my car.
117	6	Next chance I got, I stopped and took a picture of it.
117	7	Yep.
117	8	I saw me a UFO.
117	9	I drove on home imagining all the imaginary internet points I'd get for that picture.
117	10	Then I got home and put the picture onto my computer and looked at in at max magnification.
117	11	Totally a weather balloon miles and miles away.
117	12	Looked like a chrome sphere 5 miles away following my car.
118	0	Well, it's kind of a funny story..
118	1	my first real "girlfriend" placed rules and regulations like it was an iTunes license agreement..
118	2	My friends and I have dubbed these, "The Chronicles of Kendra" (name NOT changed for safety because F her..)
118	3	1.
118	4	Under no circumstances am I to surprise her at home, work, or anywhere, regardless of the reason.
118	5	No surprise dinners, no "boo!
118	6	" scares for fun, nothing.
118	7	2.
118	8	When out in public, no public displays of affection.
118	9	No hand holding, no kissing, no arm around her, hugging.
118	10	We had to walk beside each other like we were brother and sister.
118	11	3.
118	12	We worked in the mall, at different stores, and during times when our shifts matched up, we had 15 minutes or prearranged time together.
118	13	No less, no more, and it was to be at whatever time she visited.
118	14	Under no circumstances was I to visit her at work earlier, later, or otherwise not prearranged.
118	15	4.
118	16	During sexytimes, it was missionary, her on bottom, me on top.
118	17	No thrusting, just "put it in and lay there".
118	18	No fingers anywhere on her body, no foreplay on her at all.
118	19	She didn't shave, or trim, or anything, so it was like a forest down there (dodged a bullet there..)
118	20	5.
118	21	Also during sexytimes, and this "rule" is the one that surprises people the most because of how ridiculous it is, when SHE thought it was time for me to cum, SHE would roll over on her side and say "go finish up in the bathroom".
118	22	She was outright disgusted by cum, and under no circumstances was my cum to get on her, around her or be in the same room as her unless it was inside my nuts.
119	0	Ok, here it goes.
119	1	The first time I had ever seen anything I was 7 in Houston, Texas.
119	2	I used to like to climb on top of my mom's suburban in the driveway and stare at the stars.
119	3	One night I saw an intensely bright floating light over the treeline probably about a half mile away.
119	4	I hollered but nobody came to see it.
119	5	I did not see anything else until March of 2008.
119	6	This experience happened between the 10th and the 15th, but I can't give a specific date because I was up for 4 days trying to come up with some explanation to satisfy what I had seen.
119	7	This was in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
119	8	My mother lived in a garden home community, all houses the same size, all one story, and you had great visibility distance wise.
119	9	I walked out of my buddy's place at exactly 4 AM to a bright starry night.
119	10	When I walked out something caught my eye to the left of me.
119	11	I looked over and saw a bright blue, yellow, green, white, red, orange strobing flashing light floating silently to the left.
119	12	I stood in awe at it and did not want to go grab anyone because I didn't want to miss anything.
119	13	I watched as it passed in front of the moon behind my friend's place and I saw the outline of the craft.
119	14	It was a teardrop, sunflower seed type shape, and the craft seemed to have the lights being transmitted from the top half of it.
119	15	It was almost as if it was transmitting some type of light pattern upward.
119	16	It also had a dark, thin, smooth line of exhaust that disappeared 50-75 feet behind it.
119	17	This all occurred no less than 400 yards away from me.
119	18	After it passed the moon I ran inside and grabbed someone.
119	19	He saw it but it was too far away to make out what it was.
119	20	I went home which was only a few blocks away and looked out from the driveway the same direction the first craft had come from.
119	21	I saw two dim white lights slowly coming over the horizon at a slow pace heading towards me.
119	22	I then ran inside and grabbed my mother out of bed.
119	23	We stood there for about 20 minutes while 5 separate crafts flew over us, first came two, then two, then one, about 6-7 minutes apart from each other, maybe 20 mph, maybe 200 feet up, completely silent.
119	24	The way that they looked from underneath was each one had two huge bright white lights which were maybe 30-40 feet across each but they were so bright it was hard to get a good estimate.
119	25	They also had a pulsating red one between the white lights that dimmed and re-lit.
119	26	I would estimate from the size of the white lights that each craft was maybe between 150-200 feet wide.
119	27	The last craft that flew over us flew over lower and slower than the first four had.
119	28	Then, it made a noise.
119	29	It let out a sound that to this day haunts me.
119	30	What I could best compare it to would be this sound http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxzArT3bH0Y[1] followed immediately after by this sound http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpDxgmCofnU[2] .
119	31	That's the best I could find.
119	32	Take those two sounds, except make it digital, and multiply it by 50, this...was...loud.
119	33	The craft did that twice.
119	34	These crafts flew directly over us and I believe that the sound was an acknowledgement.
119	35	Whatever was piloting it knew we were watching it, kind of like a hello.
119	36	I immediately started crying, I had no idea what I was looking at or had just heard.
119	37	The second big experience I had occurred a couple weeks later.
119	38	I was standing in my driveway smoking a cigarette listening to my ipod somewhere around 2 AM.
119	39	I decided to pause my ipod to turn on the back light, waved my hand over it a couple times making somewhat of a strobe pattern.
119	40	I didn't hear anything, I didn't see anything come up, but I got that being watched feeling.
119	41	I looked up, and directly above me was a trapezoid shaped craft with rounded edges that had a dark red and black pulsating glowing outline.
119	42	It was like flowing electricity.
119	43	It was not even 75 feet up, I could have hit this thing with a rock.
119	44	I stood there while it hovered directly above me completely silent for maybe 10-15 seconds while it made this kind of motion similar to the ball that Luke trained with in Star Wars.
119	45	It hovered side to side, front to back in a smooth motion, never getting more than 20 feet away from its original position.
119	46	It was extremely fascinating, but I was frozen stiff.
119	47	After those few seconds, I waved one hand at it in a friendly manner, it then changed light pattern and hovered away behind my house.
119	48	Upon deeper inspection, the fact that it knew that I saw it but made no effort to evade my detection makes me think it wanted me to follow it, although I was too freaked out to think about that at the time.
119	49	I have seen that same craft on 3 other different occasions, once again in Tuscaloosa, once in Hoover, and once in Bessemer.
119	50	The time I saw it in Hoover was at an apartment complex at the top of a huge hill with a great overlook.
119	51	It was night time and I was with friends.
119	52	Over the overlook, I saw a grey craft facing my direction that looked similar to a Hoth fighter(forgive the star wars references), and as soon as I saw it, it took off to the right silently extremely quick.
119	53	The times in Bessemer and Tuscaloosa the trapezoid shape appeared in the sky solid white, stretched to twice its length, then the bottom shot up to the front, like it hit light speed or something.
119	54	I do frequently see what I like to call streaks.
119	55	They look like shooting stars only very low, move slower, but they still have tails that stream behind them.
119	56	They can also appear in many different colors.
119	57	One strange story is one night when I had a dream in Tuscaloosa.
119	58	In the dream, I couldn't see or hear anything, but I could feel things.
119	59	I was laying on something cold, and I felt what seemed like rubber between my legs around my junk.
119	60	It was very strange to me since a lot of people who report abductions report sperm and eggs being taken for breeding programs.
119	61	The next morning, I went to let the dog out in the backyard, which is very small.
119	62	To the left of the patio, there was a solid white ring in the grass that was maybe 8-10 feet wide.
119	63	I showed my mother and she had told me that she heard a noise that woke her up the night before, but she just dismissed it.
119	64	Another extremely confusing experience I had occurred in my driveway in Tuscaloosa.
119	65	To give you an idea of where this occurred, look up Shelton State Community College.
119	66	The house was less than a quarter mile from the campus in the Englewood neighborhood.
119	67	It was night time and I heard this static that I could compare to a jet, I looked over and directly above the community college was a light blue slit in the sky.
119	68	I would say it was maybe two hundred yards long, completely vertical, and had what looked like white electric currents coming off of both sides of it.
119	69	I looked at it and maybe about 25 white things shot out of the slit to the left one at a time at a quick pace leaving the trail behind it that I previously talked about.
119	70	After they passed, the bottom of the slit went upward until the slit closed, and it made a strange sound, and then it was gone.
119	71	I've also had a bunch of experiences with orbs.
119	72	Some solid lit that float across the sky or move in strange patterns, and some that brighten up to a great intensity and then fade as they pass.
119	73	After that first big experience I started doing some research because I was so confused.
119	74	I understand that I've had an abnormally large amount of experiences, and I honestly can't tell you why, I wish I could.
119	75	I found a type of UFO witness called a contactee.
119	76	These people are similar to abductees except they are kept up with.
119	77	I have no idea why I have had so many experiences, and I have only listed a fraction of them.
119	78	My best guess would be that since I acknowledged the presence of whatever it was I was seeing, it decided to keep up with me.
119	79	It's kind of a gift and a curse.
119	80	There are so few people that I can talk with about it and be taken seriously.
119	81	I want to seek hypnotherapy to see if there might be anything else I could uncover.
119	82	I'm grateful but still don't know much about my experiences.
119	83	If y'all can get anything out of what I shared then great.
119	84	If you have any questions I'll be glad to answer them.
120	0	I wish I had come here earlier...well actually my story is probably common.
120	1	Oh well here it goes.
120	2	So I had been working at a golf course for 3-4 years, this was in high-school.
120	3	Making minimum wage etc, no big deal at the time.
120	4	Anyway my job was to clean out golf carts of beer cans, smokes, other garbage after it had done a round.
120	5	Then we had to wash them down and put them away.
120	6	So one night after a tournament I'm down at the cart barn cleaning the carts.
120	7	In one cart I noticed there was a jacket, which wasn't all that unusual (people forget things all the time).
120	8	I finally got to that cart and grabbed the jacket to bring it up to the pro-shop
120	9	so we could determine who's it was.
120	10	As I picked up the jacket I noticed a wallet inside (I wasn't sifting through his pockets or anything, but it was a windbreaker with a 4 pound wallet.
120	11	Hard not to notice).
120	12	I knew we'd have to check his wallet anyways, for ID.
120	13	So I just grabbed it to wanted to make sure it wasn't someone I knew personally, that way I could just go up to the restaurant and give it to him.
120	14	As I open it I realize he liked to carry cash...apparently.
120	15	I didn't count it, but I can say it was easily over $2k.
120	16	Only hundreds.
120	17	The thought crossed my mind, I knew it wasn't any of the members of the course or anything.
120	18	Just a greenfee'r.
120	19	I could make his wallet disappear pretty easily if I wanted to.
120	20	But the little voice in my head told me to forget that thought and bring it up to the shop.
120	21	So following my good instinct I did.
120	22	The guys there grabbed it and called the owner (they had his information from his tee-time).
120	23	They said he was on his way and I jokingly said to them "Remind him that I take tips!".
120	24	After that I left to get back to work.
120	25	Not 15 minutes later I see a white escalade fly up the cart-only path right to the pro-shop.
120	26	A fat middle aged looking guy jumps out runs in and runs out.
120	27	Gets in his vehicle and drives away.
120	28	I figured I'd just let it go, maybe he forgot, or got distracted or...whatever.
120	29	The point was I did the right thing.
120	30	My mind was promptly changed when I talked to the pro who had given him his wallet back.
120	31	Apparently he (the pro) had told the man he's really lucky he found that wallet and that it was in fact me who returned it.
120	32	And that maybe he (wallet guy) should consider tipping me or at least a thanks.
120	33	Wallet guy told the pro that he would make sure I was taken care of.
120	34	Needless to say this guy took off without the thanks or tip.
120	35	After that I'd sooner take the money then bother being nice.
120	36	Not that anyone does nice things for perks...but still.
120	37	It was pretty shitty to be left invisible after returning not only his wallet, but more cash than I'd know what to do with.
121	0	When I was twelve, my parents got me a baby green garden snake for my birthday.
121	1	I named the little guy Salazar, for obvious reasons.
121	2	He was awesome.
121	3	All green and smooth
121	4	and he had these kick-ass snake eyes.
121	5	He used to slither all over, wrap around my arm, spit white shit on our furniture.
121	6	Snake stuff.
121	7	A couple weeks later, I walked over to his terrarium to give him his morning meal, to find Salazar in a twisted *S* shape, mouth open, stiff as a twig.
121	8	He was pretty fucking dead.
121	9	Upon closer inspection (trying to see through the hot tears erupting from my eyes), I realized the little guy had fangs.
121	10	Not normal snake teeth, serious business fangs.
121	11	It turns out my best bud in the world was a baby Green Mamba, who had been picked up by accident in Florida (he'd somehow been blown or shipped there in the confusion of a recent hurricane), and then sent to my home state of Cali.
121	12	Green Mambas are some of the most venomous, dangerous snakes in the world.
121	13	The white shit he'd been spitting (and I never really bothered to look into it, though it had always worried me) was venom, and *shit*.
121	14	I regret his death, and miss him dearly to this very day, so many years later.
121	15	But I'm glad he didn't kill my entire family, all of our other pets, and me.
121	16	RIP in our front garden until the end of times, Salazar Short-lived.
121	17	:(
121	18	(edit grammms and also the reason he died is because we weren't feeding him correctly.
121	19	Green mambas don't eat dead crickets or snake pellets, they eat live animals...)
122	0	I went to pick up a friend at her house, and was introduced to her new roommate, Tom.
122	1	Tom and I chatted for a few minutes while I waited for my friend to get ready.
122	2	I didn't think anything of it, but a few weeks later, Tom showed up at my work.
122	3	It was a bit odd, but not totally weird since I work in the public domain.
122	4	He told me it was his birthday, and that his gift to himself was to give me a gift: a CD.
122	5	Totally cute and endearing, right?
122	6	After work, I went home and put on what I assumed would be a mixed CD.
122	7	Nope.
122	8	It was a CD of love songs he had written about me on his ukulele and recorded.
122	9	At this point, alarm bells started to sound.
122	10	He had met me for literally about ten minutes, and from that had decided that he was in love with me and that he would write love songs in my honour?
122	11	It was over-the top, but it was also pretty flattering, and I'm into being adored.
122	12	I ended up going on a date with him.
122	13	While I wasn't particularly attracted to Tom (he blinked infrequently and worked as a night janitor in a slaughterhouse), and I let him know I wasnt into dating him, I WAS into having casual sex with people I was even mildly intrigued by.
122	14	So I did, and it was creepy.
122	15	He was completely silent and kept his eyes closed the entire time.
122	16	I disappeared myself in a hurry.
122	17	A few days later I ran into my friend the friend who was roommates with Tom.
122	18	She was horrified that I had gone on a date with him, and when I told her that Id slept with him, she went berserk.
122	19	Did you even LISTEN to the CD?
122	20	she shouted at me.
122	21	I told her yes, I had.
122	22	To ALL of the songs?
122	23	Yes, I had, although admittedly some of them were hard to make out because he mumbled a bit and it was a scratchy recording.
122	24	She then recited the lyrics of the songs back to me, as he had performed them for her before recording them.
122	25	There were a number of disastrous mishearings, my favorite being where I had thought the lyrics were Make love in the mud, but where he ACTUALLY sings Make love in their blood.
122	26	The song, unbeknownst to me, was about he and I getting married, inviting all of our friends to our wedding, killing them, and having sex in their blood.
122	27	For months after, he would call me in the middle of the night repeatedly and hang up.
122	28	When I called him on it, he told me he must have been calling my name in his sleep.
122	29	Riiight.
123	0	This is the stupidest, most pointless story I could think of.
123	1	When I was in grade 8 (lolCanada)
123	2	I was a bit of a know-it-all; more because of my personality, not because I made shit up for the sake of it.
123	3	Anyway, I attended one of the few remaining "invite everyone you know"-style birthday parties for one of my friends from class, and for roughly 40 minutes, off and on, a bunch of the other kids spent their time trying to convince me that Tony Hawk's real name was in fact, not actually Tony Hawk (this was relevant to my interests at the time given THPS2 was, and is, one of the most badass games that has ever existed.
123	4	)
123	5	Since I'm not completely retarded, hadn't been known for caving to peer pressure, and genuinely didn't really give a shit, I decided to concede after the seventh or eighth time this topic of conversation came up (amusingly enough, with some of the same people) and it was like the fucking world series was won by the home team, and everyone all reached orgasm in unison.
123	6	The plebes at this crappy party had won the war.
123	7	Through some herculean effort of cunning wit and determination, they had achieved victory...
123	8	Part of my brain dies a little when I recall this specific memory, and another part is absolutely fucking relieved I know exactly zero of my old classmates.
124	0	When I was 9 years old, I finally made my first real friend.
124	1	She lived one street over and we could see each other from our houses, if I stood on our back porch and if she stood in the playroom of her house.
124	2	We'd each grab a flashlight and flash the lights to say goodnight.
124	3	One Summer night, after our goodnight signals, I stayed up a little longer.
124	4	There was a different flash of light, down a little ways from her house, in the street.
124	5	I had my Dad's binoculars, so I grabbed them to get a better look.
124	6	There were more flashes and men running in the street, then one man lying in the street, not moving.
124	7	Scared, I ran to my parents' bedroom and told Mom what I saw.
124	8	She didn't say anything, but turned me towards my room and told me to go to bed.
124	9	I went, but I was afraid to go to sleep.
124	10	The next day, the police knocked on the door.
124	11	Mom answered, but held me very tightly and answered questions quickly.
124	12	If I even tried to say anything, she squeezed me, so I didn't say anything.
124	13	Then, she sent me to my room and finished talking to the police.
124	14	When they left, she didn't tell me anything, even after I asked.
124	15	When Dad got home, they went into their bedroom and talked for a long time.
124	16	After that, we had dinner.
124	17	Neither the police nor what I'd seen the night before got any mention, so I almost felt as if they hadn't happened.
124	18	There was no flashlight in the window that night, or the night after that.
124	19	I went over to my friend's house and everyone was wearing black and crying.
124	20	Her father had died.
124	21	I told her I was sorry and left.
124	22	When I got home, I sat on my bed and cried.
124	23	I'd seen my best friend's father get killed!
124	24	Not too long afterward, she came to the house to say goodbye.
124	25	They were moving away to live with her aunt, somewhere far away.
124	26	We hugged and cried.
124	27	I knew we wouldn't see each other again, but also felt this was punishment for not helping to catch the men who killed her father.
124	28	I felt horrible about this, and still do.
124	29	I asked my parents about this fairly recently and Mom said she didn't want our family in trouble for what my friend's father had done.
124	30	He'd been stealing money from his workplace and the men who killed him were his partners in crime.
124	31	He tried to get away without paying them their share, supposedly.
124	32	When I told Mom about my guilt and how I'd lost my friend, she just shrugged and said that life is about bigger stuff.
125	0	I used to be an Over the road truck driver delivering to dollar stores all around the northeast United states.
125	1	It was fun for a while but I eventually got sick of not really having a "home".
125	2	Anyways, one of my favorite stories...
125	3	Happened of course when nobody else was around to corroborate the story.
125	4	I was in the middle of the backroads of upstate New York somewhere in the middle of the night, I'm gonna say around 2 AM or so.
125	5	I was cruising around 50 MPH or so, since there were no cars, and the road was wide open.
125	6	So I'm chugging along fully loaded on my way to the first store when I see what looked like a small bump, no big deal.
125	7	As I get closer I realize exactly how big this bump is and the fact that in reality it's a raised railroad track.
125	8	By this time, I was way too damn close to slow down at all.
125	9	I swear to god when it was all said and done I managed to get at least 5 feet of air in that thing.
125	10	After the shock of what just happened settled, and I realized that I landed it without breaking anything, I let out one of the most fulfilled screams of excitement as if I had just gotten off of the worlds best roller coasters.
125	11	My company obviously was never told of this one.
125	12	I have many more stories if anyone wants to hear them.
126	0	My G/F's mothers wedding 2 years ago Her future brother in law was missing for 2 weeks.
126	1	he was supposed to be the best man but on a delivery he vanished and no one knew where he went.
126	2	That morning her future husband got a call that the police had found him.
126	3	He had been shot 2 times and died in a ditch the delivery truck full of packages was gone.
126	4	The husband was horrified and told the bride that he cant get married today.
126	5	She slapped him and stormed out screaming that she cant believe the *HE* could be so selfish that today wasn't just about him and his **stupid brother**.My gf was just as mad ...
126	6	Me and the husband both left them that day and are good friends to this day.
127	0	I always feel that popular films give us guys a bad impression.
127	1	Not all of us are heavy metal lovers in jagged jeans and rowdy looking.
127	2	Years on the road has given us a lot of stories, and lot of experiences.
127	3	The best part is the interstate driving , lots to see and the ever waving hands of kids in cars.
127	4	I have a CB radio that i often use to amuse the children with .For trips lasting more than a day , its pretty much fun only if you have company.
127	5	Gas stations and truckers stop are a wonderful meeting point .
127	6	Most of the time,i have no idea of the variety of things i would haul.
127	7	Just in vague terms like merchandising or household goods.
127	8	Once i was travelling up north and came up behind a car that was going at a steady pace but waving in and out of the lanes.
127	9	Me and my partner had a guess that , the driver was going sleepy and we tried our best to catch up along the car.
127	10	We noticed tha car had the CB antenna sticking up and were able to get the particular person on CB.
127	11	We were able to jog awake the person and convince him to take a break.
127	12	The driver was a doctor who was going upstate to attend a call.
128	0	I'm a hospice nurse.
128	1	When people are really close to death you have to be really careful with them.
128	2	You have to turn unconscious people every two hours to prevent skin breakdown.
128	3	Sometimes when you turn them, their lungs collapse and they die.
128	4	Sometimes they aspirate (inhale)their liquid medications, no matter how carefully or slowly you give them and they die.
128	5	Sometimes when you bathe them, they die.
128	6	Sometimes, I feel like a mass murderer and I really hate my job.
128	7	I'm really good at my job and I know that I make a positive difference in my patient's and families lives and I love that part.
128	8	I'm also scared because I don't cry any more or feel anything when people die, like my heart is a rock in my chest.
129	0	I just want everyone in this thread to know that after reading this thread on the couch in the dark at 11 PM, I got scared and reached over to switch on the lamp...and the light bulb POPPED LOUDLY AND WENT OUT.
129	1	The new bulbs are in the kitchen.
129	2	I'm too scared to get off the couch now.
129	3	I think I may be stuck here 'til morning.
129	4	*looks for cute, non-threatening puppy and kitten pics*
130	0	My son was 3 when I got into a heated argument with my wife over water safety one day when we were at the beach.
130	1	I didn't feel like she was paying attention as much as one should when around the water.
130	2	I had just arrived from work and saw something I didn't like and said some things in a way I should not have.
130	3	Needless to say I felt like an ass both for what I said, how I said it and because I knew I had not made my point properly.
130	4	2 weeks later I arrived at the beach again after work.
130	5	My son ran up to me gave me a hug and wanted to kick a soccer ball around.
130	6	A couple minutes later I heard a sound and so I turned to look at the water.
130	7	A mom was swimming into shore from a floating dock and her 5 or 6 year old was walking into the water out to meet her mom.
130	8	Mom was saying "One minute, I'm coming...
130	9	be right there..."
130	10	But the daughter kept walking, past her knees past her waist...
130	11	My son kicked the soccer ball, and I remember it rolled right by me, but I was mesmerized by what was going on.
130	12	"Daddy?
130	13	Daddy...?
130	14	" I faintly heard.
130	15	The mothers voice grew more worried, she grew more frantic.
130	16	She was not a strong/fast swimmer at all, no more so than your average parent and she was still 100m or more away.
130	17	Daughter kept walking in right up to her chest and then
130	18	She turned, she knew she was in trouble.
130	19	Her eyes bulged from her face as she turned around, lips trembling, then silently, without a yelp nor a peep, slipped underwater.
130	20	Nary a ripple left a mark.
130	21	By that point I was already crashing across the field and beach to dive into where I last saw her.
130	22	I dove in, dove down, and touched nothing.
130	23	She was gone.
130	24	I wear contacts because of my exceedingly bad eye sight.
130	25	I opened my eyes as I dove in and water blasted my eyes, causing one contact to fly out and the other just floated around on top of my eye.
130	26	I could see nothing.
130	27	I extended my hands all around and felt the faint touch of lake grass on the bottom... or was that hair?
130	28	I grabbed it her head, shoulders and waist and threw her up onto my shoulder as I struggled fully clothed in a suit (sans jacket), to walk the 4 or 5 steps to shore I new would be all I needed to break the surface myself.
130	29	She was fine, albeit a bit scared.
130	30	I put her down and she didn't even cough.
130	31	Through the whole episode she was underwater for less than 20 seconds I would guess.
130	32	I looked around and out of the 40 or 50 people around the area, only two had taken note of the 250lbs crazy guy running flat out across the beach only to dive into the water fully clothed.
130	33	Not a single person other than myself and the mom saw the girl go under.
131	0	When I was 9 I was playing in the parj with some other kids.
131	1	One kid who was like 3 slipped and fell because it was raining, he started crying.
131	2	His mom wasnt paying attention talking on her phone like the stupid fucking cunt she is, so I picked up the kid and took him over to the woman.
131	3	I said ma'am, your son fell down.
131	4	She starts screaming (still on the phone) at me like "WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU, YOU COULD HAVE HURT HIM," and she starts cushioning the kid.
131	5	Then she goes over to the grandma and starts bitching her out like "HOW THE FUCK COULD YOU LET HIM DO THAT, CONTROL HIM," and my tiny little old grandma says, "Okay, next time I'll tell him to leave your toddler with his face in wet sand, while you babble to your whore friends about how big your vaginas are.
131	6	" And we promptly left.
132	0	Not a very spectacular story but true.
132	1	I've always felt some encounter stories were real, but what made me truly believe was one night standing outside watching the stars.
132	2	It was late, maybe 2 a.m., and out in the country so it was dark, no street lights, very little to no moon.
132	3	I was watching what I thought was a satellite moving across the sky from right to left.
132	4	Didn't think twice about it as I saw them all the time.
132	5	Suddenly, the "satellite" stopped and shot off FAST, totally disappeared, at a 45-degree angle from the direction it came.
132	6	I have never ever seen a satellite change direction ever.
132	7	It startled me so much I stood there for a bit wondering if I really saw it or not, but I did, 100% certain.
132	8	It's unfortunate no one was there with me that night.
133	0	Back when I was a 15 year old lad we went on a day excursion to the bush (Adelaide, Australia) for my outdoor activities class for school.
133	1	The whole day we were pretty much out in the bush and doing bush activities.
133	2	Naturally, my hands got dirty and were probably swarming with diarrhea-causing micro-organisms.
133	3	About an hour before we left I went back to the bus to grab my food only to find out that someone had opened my packet of kettle chips.
133	4	I interrogated some of my buddies who were sitting on the bus eating too.
133	5	All of them played dumb
133	6	but I could see a hint of a smirk of their faces.
133	7	I was suspicious but I ate the chips anyway.
133	8	Oh god why did I do that.
133	9	On the 30 minute bus ride home I started to have that all too familiar sensation of rectal contractions.
133	10	There would be an initial build up of pressure, it would then peak where I really had to focus on clenching my cheeks and finally followed by a period of relief when the shit would be pushed back up my rectum.
133	11	It was a cyclic process but the moments of relief would become more few and far between as the bus ride went on.
133	12	Now I was no amateur to fighting rectal contractions.
133	13	I've had a few close calls but I've ALWAYS made it to a toilet in the past.
133	14	This gave me supreme confidence in my shit-holding abilities.
133	15	I knew if I could just hold on long enough, we'd get off the bus
133	16	and I could find a school toilet to unload in.
133	17	Once the bus stopped, I acted cool and as soon as I was out of vision of my class mates I ran to the nearest bathroom.
133	18	As if trolled by god himself, we had arrived back to the school late and all the bathrooms were locked.
133	19	I gave up a little at that point and a 5cm turd fell out.
133	20	This provided no relief nor reduced any of the pressure and I knew I had to make the arduous 1.5 kilometres journey home from school.
133	21	At the beginning of my journey, a close mate who was walking home from the same excursion waved at me.
133	22	I was in front of him by about 50 metres.
133	23	I gave no fucks about him that day and kept walking in fear of him being able to smell the turd in my pants.
133	24	During the journey home, I couldn't run and had to walk very slowly, all the while putting a profound amount of effort into countering the peristalsis of my bowels.
133	25	It felt like a marathon to get home - I was sweating profusely, my vision became blurry and I was breathing heavily.
133	26	By the time I made it to my front door I was at the end of my tether.
133	27	Despite the toilet being only 10m away on the other side of the door, I began evacuating my bowels there and then through my underwear on the front porch.
133	28	Some of it got caught between my shoes and socks.
133	29	I opened the front door and ran to the toilet, all the while leaving a trail of shit.
133	30	Even in the bathroom, I was still shitting on the floor and toilet lid before I even managed to sit down.
133	31	**I couldn't stop this waterfall of faecal-coloured chocolate mousse coming out of my anus.
133	32	** Yes that was the consistency.
133	33	And due to the fact the majority of my bowels had been emptied on the front porch/house floor/bathroom floor I did feel a bit of relief at this point.
133	34	Little did I know my dad had the witnessed the whole thing the moment I had opened the front door.
133	35	He was a fucking lad that day.
133	36	He told me to go in the shower and that he'd clean the mess up.
133	37	In the shower I was fucking crying hysterically, while at the same time still shitting and pushing the shit through shower drain with my feet.
133	38	After I got out the shower, my dad told me not to tell my mum and get some rest.
133	39	We haven't mentioned it since.
133	40	I went back to school the next day acting perfectly normal despite feeling violated.
133	41	Just in case my mates did put laxative powder in my chips, I didn't want to give them the satisfaction that it even worked.
133	42	But my fucking fuck, it worked.
133	43	On the other hand, it could have been the simple case I just didn't wash my hands.
133	44	Til this day, I still don't know and it haunts me.
134	0	Sorry if this has already been told.
134	1	Tried a search which turned up nothing, but you never know.
134	2	Late at night on a highway in Northern Ontario, a woman driving her car is reliieved to finally find a gas station that's still open, so she pulls in.
134	3	The attendant comes out and walks up to the driver's side.
134	4	He stands there, waiting until she rolls down her window.
134	5	She slips it down just a crack.
134	6	"How much?
134	7	" he asks.
134	8	She tells him to fill it up.
134	9	The attendant walks towards the back of the car and stands there a minute.
134	10	The woman waits, then looks into the side-view mirror.
134	11	The attendant is just standing there, facing her.
134	12	She's feeling pretty nervous, wondering why he's not pumping gas.
134	13	Then he walks back up to the window and taps on it.
134	14	"You need to open the flap ma'am.
134	15	"
134	16	Feeling stupid, the woman reaches down and clicks the gas flap open.
134	17	The attendant walks back and starts pumping the gas.
134	18	A minute or so later he finishes, and clicks the nozzle back into place on the pump.
134	19	Then he stands there for a moment.
134	20	The woman keeps looking at him in the side-view mirror, feeling quite ill-at-ease.
134	21	She doesn't like this: being alone at a tiny gas station in the middle of nowhere with only this stranger.
134	22	The attendant then walks back up to the window and taps on it.
134	23	She reaches into her purse and takes out her credit card, rolls open the window just a crack again, and as she passes the card through looks up at the attendant.
134	24	He's staring down at her with wide, frightful eyes.
134	25	She looks away quickly, really creeped out, and she rolls the window back up as soon as the attendant grasps the card.
134	26	But he doesn't go to the cash booth, he just stands there a moment.
134	27	The woman can't bear to look at him again.
134	28	Finally he says, with a voice muffled through the closed window: "Ma'am, there's a problem with your card.
134	29	Could you please step inside the cash booth?
134	30	"
134	31	"What's wrong with the card?
134	32	" she asks loudly, with a definite strain in her voice.
134	33	"Something's wrong with the barcode.
134	34	I'll need you to come over to the cash so we can make a call to the company.
134	35	"
134	36	There's no way she is getting outside her car, on an empty, dark highway, late at night, with only that weirdo around.
134	37	Besides, she realizes, as a sudden chill overcomes her, how could he know if there was a problem with the barcode if he hadn't even been to the cash desk to swipe it?
134	38	The woman's breathing suddenly increases as she feels panic creep upon her.
134	39	She summons up a note of restraint in her voice: "Please, can you just call them yourself?
134	40	"
134	41	"Sorry, but I'll need to see some I.D.
134	42	Could you please just step over to the booth?
134	43	It'll only take a minute.
134	44	"
134	45	Realizing he won't let it be, she whispers a prayer and reaches into her purse to check for cash.
134	46	Yes!
134	47	She has a fifty dollar bill.
134	48	Clutching it in her hand she unrolls the window just a crack yet again and passes it through.
134	49	"Nevermind, I'll just pay cash.
134	50	"
134	51	"Ma'am, are you sure?
134	52	" he asks.
134	53	"What?
134	54	" she almost yells, as she accidentally looks up at him again.
134	55	The same wide, fearful eyes staring down at her.
134	56	She looks away.
134	57	"Yes!
134	58	Cash!
134	59	"
134	60	"I can fix the card problem, you just need to come over to the phone with me," he says.
134	61	She's really terrified now, and half-screams at the man: "Listen asshole, it's cash!
134	62	That's all your getting from me!
134	63	"
134	64	"Alright, alright," he responds, "Now you just wait right here and I'll go get your change.
134	65	Don't move.
134	66	I'll be right back.
134	67	"
134	68	She can see him out of her peripheral vision, walking backwards towards the booth, always facing her.
134	69	She can't bear to look his way.
134	70	She can't imagine what he has in the booth.
134	71	What if he brings it back with him?
134	72	*Fuck the change,* she thinks, just as she realizes he also still has her credit card.
134	73	She can't take this anymore: *Fuck the card, I'll cancel it!
134	74	*
134	75	She starts up the car and as soon as it hums to life she tears away and off into the dark night.
134	76	The attendant is in his booth on the phone, breathing heavily.
134	77	An official-sounding voice on the other end asks: "Did you tell her?
134	78	"
134	79	"No," the attendant responds, "I couldn't.
134	80	"
134	81	"Why not?
134	82	"
134	83	"He had a knife and a finger to his lips.
134	84	I tried to get her out of there, but the whole time he was watching me from the floor behind her seat.
134	85	"
135	0	Some backstory: My parents are fundamentalist Christians, and my mom is a further bit more off than even that.
135	1	I left it all behind halfway through college.
135	2	After college, I had to live at home for a few months because my friend that I was moving in with hadn't found us a place yet.
135	3	I had, at the time a Mitsubishi, and I loved it as much as a man could love a car without becoming one of those strange dudes that puts his dick in the exhaust (they are out there, google them.
135	4	)
135	5	The car itself had nice metal wheels, but on top of the lug nuts in the center were plastic wheel caps.
135	6	The caps themselves were circular and about 4 inches in diameter, with the mitsubishi logo in the middle.
135	7	For those of you that don't know, the logo is simply three diamonds pointing outward.
135	8	So one day, I notice that the silver paint is chipping off of my wheel caps, and I decide to be a (fake) man and DIY it by taking them off and spray painting them with a fresh coat of "fuck yeah" silver.
135	9	I took the caps, put them on a newspaper, painted them, and then set the whole package on the kitchen counter to dry.
135	10	About an hour later, I'm sitting in the living room fucking around on the internet when my mom comes home from whatever she had been doing.
135	11	She took one look down at my wheel caps and froze.
135	12	"What are *those*?
135	13	"
135	14	"Huh?
135	15	"
135	16	"*Those*.
135	17	"
135	18	Her voice was so full of malice at that point that I knew it was about to get bad.
135	19	This was my mom, and although you of course have no context, I'll just sum her up by saying this was a woman that once, in the middle of our family outing, had a screaming match with a schizophrenic woman because my mom confused the woman'ts mumblings from across the restaurant as her being a "*witch casting spells on our family.
135	20	*"
135	21	Back to the story.
135	22	"What are *those*?
135	23	"
135	24	"Huh?
135	25	"
135	26	"*Those*.
135	27	"
135	28	"Uh, wheel caps for my car?
135	29	I took them off so I could paint..."
135	30	Before I could finish, she exploded and started screaming at the top of her lungs about how she was almost convinced that they were "satanic ninja stars," and that she was about to kick me out of the house if I thought I was gonna come in here with that kind of satanic propaganda.
135	31	She went off like that for about five minutes, prayed in tongues for another five minutes, and then refused to talk to me for the rest of the day.
135	32	I moved across the country soon after that.
136	0	I remember this in hindsight.
136	1	At 21 I was dating with and living with a 20 year old who had two parents who were involved in healthcare.
136	2	We worked in healthcare.
136	3	It was her ultimate goal to be an OB/GYN.
136	4	She studied the vagina, birth, and women's health even before she was done with her bachelors.
136	5	She had been diagnosed with irregular periods ages before we started dating.
136	6	She was also on birth control.
136	7	That didn't stop her from taking a home pregnancy test every time her period was one or two days off.
136	8	I once not so jokingly told her that if we had Native American names hers would be "Pees on Sticks".
136	9	She was obsessed with the idea that her BC wasn't working and I had knocked her up.
136	10	She was obsessed with taking a home pregnancy test at least once every month to two months.
136	11	Warning this part is NSFW/NSFL:
136	12	Then one month she had a really horrible period where she passed a bunch of lining and bled a ton.
136	13	Any girl who has really bad periods knows that when they pass a bunch of uterine lining during their period its pretty nasty.
136	14	She insisted that she had just miscarried our unborn child.
136	15	Refused to take a pregnancy test to confirm.
136	16	Refused to acknowledge the fact that she had her period last month and if she had miscarried the zygote would be so tiny she would never notice (mind you, her parents were both RNs and she read and watched everything about pregnancy and childbirth she could get her hands on).
136	17	Refused to go to the doctor to get a blood test.
136	18	(Most times when you miscarry there is enough HCG in the blood or urine that a pregnancy test ends up positive still.
136	19	)
136	20	So this girl who was absolutely obsessed with taking the home pee tests to the point we could have had stock in EPT refused to take a home pregnancy test.
136	21	At all.
136	22	Nope.
136	23	She insisted she had miscarried.
136	24	So she started mourning.
136	25	Told her parents she had miscarried.
136	26	Told all our mutual friends she had miscarried.
136	27	And then made me feel bad because I didn't grieve.
136	28	She even named her period lining (a male name, because she knew it would have been a boy) and bought a special miscarriage remembrance necklace from some vendor online, so she could always wear it and never forget her poor miscarried uterine lining.
137	0	I was on the bus and noticed some guy on his blackberry, dozed off for a few minutes and woke up and noticed the guy left his phone on the bus.
137	1	I picked it up and tried to find a number in it i could call to let him know i had it.
137	2	Checked his facebook and saw he updated his status from home saying some thug on the bus robbed him he also said how horrible people are in Los Angeles, how its a city filled with thieves and shit.
137	3	I updated his status correcting him, and letting him know i had it and i that i could sent it to him.
137	4	He emailed me his address and i mailed it to him....
137	5	he didnt even send a thank you email back, guy was a prick.
138	0	I love this story!!!
138	1	My venomous snake story is less awesome but the end result is the same:
138	2	When I was 10 my family and I went to Florida and visited some friends.
138	3	Being from the mountains in CO, the only snakes I'd interacted with (on a daily basis, to the extent of bringing them to school in my pockets) were Garter snakes I'd catch in the ditch at the end of my driveway.
138	4	I (still) have never seen a wild rattlesnake, though I have been able to see Gaboon vipers and Mambas at a croc park in Zambia.
138	5	But I digress!
138	6	So I was in florida, as a little 10yo girl who LOOOOVED snakes!
138	7	And what should I find at these friend's house but a SNAKE!
138	8	Being the impulsive snake-catcher that I am, I grabbed it.
138	9	Then it struck at me, which had never happened before, since I am very much loved by garter snakes.
138	10	Luckily I hadn't quite gotten my hands on it, so I was able to drop it when it made that move (and this was a tiny snake, as well).
138	11	My parents and their friends came outside since I'd screamed a bit in surprise, and they proceeded to chop off the juvenile water moccasin's head off with a shovel.
138	12	I was very sad for that snake who only died because I was too stupid to leave it alone!
138	13	I did, however, continue to habitually catch garter snakes at home and keep them as pets for a day before letting them go.
138	14	I have never owned a snake as a for real pet, though.
138	15	I'm jealous of your green mamba fun time and WTF ARE GREEN MAMBAS DOING IN FLORIDA.
139	0	When I was young anything that had to do with archaeology began to thrill me.
139	1	My mom would take me to the library to do whatever little research projects a teacher gives a 9 year old, or to finish my homework, and I would sneak old issues of National Geographic into my books or under my work.
139	2	When she wasn't looking I would go back to reading the articles about dead civilizations, the work being done to excavate their tombs and cities, and their superstitions and religions.
139	3	So when my birthday rolled around the next year, and my parents asked me what I wanted, I proudly named off several books about archaeology.
139	4	And, a few days later, I was given my birthday present - three big and heavy books about ancient societies that lived in North and South America, and the Caribbean.
139	5	It wasn't exactly what I had been expecting.
139	6	I thought that I had explicitly asked for books about ancient Greece and Egypt.
139	7	Regardless - this was something new and exciting, and the books were all about these people and excavations that had occurred for each respective society.
139	8	Being that I was only about ten years old at the time, I was (and still am, actually) a huge fan of breasts.
139	9	In one of the books there was an image of a dark figurine that had been carved, presumably, from some dark stone.
139	10	It wasn't onyx.
139	11	.
139	12	.and I can't remember what the stone actually was at this point.
139	13	But it was a figurine of a pregnant woman with enormous breasts, so I liked the picture.
139	14	It was missing its head though.
139	15	On the adjacent page was an image of a pregnant tribeswoman.
139	16	The book made the conjecture that the figurine was an ancient image/icon of a pregnant tribeswoman.
139	17	I kept looking back and forth between the two pictures.
139	18	The figurine was missing its head.
139	19	It began to unsettle me and, eventually, I became so freaked by the juxtaposition of the images that, during future readthroughs I would skip these pages entirely.
139	20	As I grew older, my interest in archaeology diminished quite a bit.
139	21	My archaeology books ended up in a donation box for the local library and I moved on to other interests, namely fantasy, sci-fi, role-playing games, etc.
139	22	Several years down the road, my parents and I went to a bed and breakfast that was owned by friends of my mother.
139	23	It's an old estate that is next to a main road.
139	24	There is the main house, where the bed and breakfast is operated, a carriage house, and about 50 yards away another smaller house which is where the owners - my mother's friends - live.
139	25	The estate is on an enormous old plot of land and, despite being next to the main road, is surrounded by apple orchards.
139	26	My parents took me up there for my 16th birthday.
139	27	Just what every 16 year-old boy wants, right?
139	28	They were going to let me drive up and back though, since I had just gotten my license, so I acquiesced and went with them.
139	29	The place was amazing.
139	30	It was enormous, there were stories of ghost sightings, all sorts of history surrounded the area, the houses on the property were all around 150 years old - and the orchards were awesome.
139	31	The staff at the B&amp;B was really cool.
139	32	Everybody was very laid back.
139	33	One of the cooks was Cerine, a thin black woman, she was very pretty but.
139	34	.
139	35	distracted?
139	36	flighty?
139	37	.
139	38	.
139	39	.and she had this really thick island accent.
139	40	Regardless, she was very entertaining, and she had an awesome laugh.
139	41	When we were all hanging out at night she would often turn her eyes toward the orchard and kind of get lost in her thoughts.
139	42	We stayed there for a little more than a week.
139	43	After the first few days I had grown somewhat bored.
139	44	I asked my mother's friend if it would be okay if I took a stroll through the orchard.
139	45	"Sure," she said, "Explore as much as you'd like but get back here before sunset, there are coyotes in the area.
139	46	" Awesome!
139	47	That childish urge to explore had woken up since I was immersed in a place that had some actual history.
139	48	Something inside of me really wanted to find an old civil war bullet or an arrowhead, anything really, out in the orchard.
139	49	The first day I was out there was really uneventful.
139	50	In fact, it grew old quick.
139	51	The property was immense, and I had explored for about two hours and all I could see was a treeline somewhere in the distance.
139	52	And my mom's friend wasn't kidding about the coyotes - I saw prints in some of the areas where the soil was softer.
139	53	There was one spot where it looked as if a couple of them had bedded down for the night.
139	54	There was a swath of terrain in between two apple trees that had been tamped down.
139	55	The soil in the middle was actually devoid of any grass or anything else.
139	56	At first I thought this was strange, but then I found a giant apple on a limb and plucked it and ate it.
139	57	On my way back to the house I got a little lost but I happened to see Cerine in the distance.
139	58	She saw me and smiled and I caught up to her.
139	59	She was humming what sounded like a lullaby.
139	60	I asked her about it and she told me that it was an island song that people in the Caribbean sang in order to calm noisy or upset spirits.
139	61	We chatted a bit, and she told me that she had been working there for about eight months.
139	62	She said that the first two and a half months had been atrocious.
139	63	When pressed she became a bit distant again and said that the spirits of the area were very restless.
139	64	I asked her how she knew and why she was so concerned.
139	65	She smiled broadly and said that all of the women in her family had a deep connection with the spirits.
139	66	She said that, soon after her arrival, she began seeing many of them.
139	67	And they began seeing her.
139	68	They began to take quite an interest in her and would bother her incessantly, particularly during the night.
139	69	"Old men and women," she said, "that couldn't find their way.
139	70	They get angry.
139	71	Very angry.
139	72	And this island song quiets them and soothes their anger.
139	73	" Being an inquisitive, and somewhat amused teenager, I asked, "Are there any spirits with us right now?
139	74	" She nodded her head and her smile disappeared somewhat.
139	75	"How many?
139	76	" I inquired.
139	77	She stopped in her tracks, all remnants of that smile disappeared and she said, "Boy, if I were to tell you the answer to that, you would pack your things and go.
139	78	" As we started walking again, I told her about the area that I had found where the grass was tamped down and talked to her about coyotes.
139	79	She had a suspicious look on her face but only said, "I don't think you should go back there, friend.
139	80	The orchard is big and there are many curious things in it.
139	81	" We got back to the B&amp;B right as the sun started to dip.
139	82	The next day we went into town and did a bunch of touristy things that my parents wanted to do.
139	83	I tagged along.
139	84	It was kind of fun, but I kept thinking about the orchard.
139	85	In particular, that one spot in the orchard.
139	86	We got back after dark and, just as my mom's friend had said, we could hear coyotes howl.
140	0	I'm not a cop, but I shared a NOPE experience with an officer.
140	1	So, a few years back my teammates
140	2	and I were heading home from a paintball tournament in Waukegan, Illinois.
140	3	Waukegan isn't the safest of towns but we felt comfortable enough to have the car windows down and enjoy the breeze after a long day of shooting people.
140	4	Traffic was heavy so we were able to take in all the beauty that Waukegan had to offer.
140	5	As our car begins to accelerate on a green light, my eye catches something out of the ordinary in my peripheral.
140	6	In the middle of a field near a stripmall was a brown electrical pole.
140	7	This particular pole had the great misfortune of being shat on by a large, disheveled woman.
140	8	A stream of shit was bouncing off of the pole as if it had a target on it.
140	9	She did not give a fuck, shitting in full view of a stripmall and hundreds of cars.
140	10	I'm still silent at this point, I couldn't possibly form a word.
140	11	A teammate screams, "IS SHE SHITTING ON A FUCKING POLE?
140	12	" I'm staring in disbelief AS a police car slowly rolls by in the opposite lane.
140	13	The cop sees the woman, brakes sharply for a moment, then stroicly looks forward and presses his nope pedal to get fuck out of there.
140	14	Thanks for the memories, Waukegan!
141	0	Several years ago (1998/99) I (male) was about 20 years old and worked with a girl that was a year or two older than me.
141	1	We became close friends and had a 'friends with benefits' situation.
141	2	One of the things I really liked about her was that she was very socially mature.
141	3	She didn't play the drama games that a lot of girls at our age.
141	4	She was very honest and kind of told things how they were.
141	5	One night after the bar, we ended up back at her place and had a long, drunken discussion.
141	6	She was from [location deleted](moved to my state in recent years) and had some meathead brothers (Jersey shore type).
141	7	She confided in me she lost her virginity to her brother's friend when she was 14.
141	8	She told the story matter of factly and didn't show much emotion.
141	9	I was angrier than she was.....
141	10	Their parents were out of town and her brothers were having a party.
141	11	One of her brother's friends was feeding her tequila (she had never drank before) until she passed out.
141	12	She briefly woke up alone in a guest bedroom, blacked out again.
141	13	Woke up again and the guy is there and he's kissing her.
141	14	She had a crush on him, so she started kissing him back.
141	15	...passed out.
141	16	Came to again and her pants are around her knees and he is holding her legs up, having sex with her.
141	17	She tried to resist, but wasn't able to put up much of a fight....she passed out again.
141	18	The next time she woke up, he was gone and her pants were still around her knees.
141	19	She staggered to the bathroom and discovered that she was bleeding from her vagina and had semen in her ass.
141	20	Her vagina and ass were so sore she couldn't sit for a week.
141	21	I go into such detail, because this is how she told it to me.
141	22	And I want you to understand how angry I was.
141	23	Although we were not in a relationship, we were very good friends (still are), and I was seeing red after hearing this story.
141	24	I felt like I was capable of murder.
141	25	This guy was a couple of states away and I figured I could pull it off and it would seem totally random.
141	26	After a couple of weeks of trying to identify this guy, I had no luck.
141	27	I managed to get her brother's phone number from her phone.
141	28	I called him, told him that I was a close friend of his sister's but it was important that she didn't know we talked.
141	29	I told him the situation and asked if he could identify the guy.
141	30	He got really quiet and almost eerily angry.
141	31	He said something like "I fucking know EXACTLY who it is.
141	32	" Apparently he was able to connect some dots somewhere.
141	33	(Remember this was 7 or 8 years after the fact).
141	34	He said something like "I'll handle this.
141	35	Thank you for calling me.
141	36	Now lose this fucking number.
141	37	" and hung up.
141	38	Suddenly my anger seemed to pale in comparison to this fucking guy.
141	39	Even though I was ready for murder, I almost felt guilty for unleashing this guy's rage.
141	40	It turned out it was his best friend from when they were small children.
141	41	About two weeks later, my friend said she had to go back home because a friend of the family had died in a jet ski accident.
141	42	When she told me the story after work, she said her brother was there and saw the whole thing (they rode jet skis together all the time).
141	43	My stomach was in knots...was this the right guy?
141	44	Then she said it... "remember when I told you about how I lost my virginity?
141	45	" ..."yeah" ..."it was that guy.
141	46	" Fuck yeah.
141	47	My only regret in the whole thing is that not everyone knows the back story.
141	48	I wish this could be an example to all of the frat house rapists out there that take advantage of young ladies.
141	49	It's good to remember that every female out there belongs to someone.
141	50	As a father of two daughters...they belong to me.
141	51	I am their protector, and will remain so until I give their hand in marriage.
141	52	If you fuck with young ladies, you have no idea the level of rage you can unleash in their protectors.
142	0	I captured a pit bull puppy in my backyard when it was chasing some workmen back there, and frankly it needed to not be running loose in my neighborhood.
142	1	He had tags, so I called the phone number-- left voice mail.
142	2	Hung out with the puppy for a bit, gave him water, etc.
142	3	Tried again, left voice mail.
142	4	Can't sit here playing with a puppy all day, though I wish I could.
142	5	Called animal control.
142	6	"Oh, yeah-- is that Jax?
142	7	Can you bring him in-- we have a seizure warrant if he's found unleashed again.
142	8	" Indicating the owners regularly let him out without supervision.
142	9	I felt bad, but called the owner's number again and left voice mail, letting them know that Jax would be at the pound, and they could pick him up there.
142	10	Took him to the pound-- this was a super-sweet pup, by the way, who totally deserved much better humans.
142	11	Fifteen minutes after I get home, they knock on my door demanding to know where the dog is.
142	12	Then they tell me I shouldn't have done anything with their dog (er... on my property, bothering people...), and how would I like it if someone took *my* dog to the pound?
142	13	"Well, ma'am.
142	14	I'd be grateful for them making sure my dog was safe.
142	15	*My* dog isn't allowed to roam around without a leash.
142	16	" I shut the door in her face and never looked back.
143	0	Bridezilla is putting it mildly.
143	1	I once flew into a foreign country for this woman's wedding since I was a bridesmaid.
143	2	The time I was there I witnessed her: shoving her daughter, starving and neglecting her pets, constantly fighting with her fiance, trying to control what I ate, accused me of stealing from her since I took a Pepsi from the refrigerator after they said to make myself at home, freaking out the night before as we were setting up because everything was wrong.
143	3	After the day had come and gone and I flew home I get an email about a month later, "You really pissed everyone off!
143	4	They all found you rude and lazy.
143	5	My husband isn't calling you names
143	6	he's only calling you out on how you are.
143	7	" I told her to have a nice life then blocked her from ever contacting me again.
143	8	Next thing I know, my family and friends are getting threatened and harassed, fake profiles were made with my name and photo, several message boards on Facebook have my name, number, and address up along with the biggest loads of bullshit for any random stranger to read.
144	0	I've posted this before but it fits this question pretty well.
144	1	I think I was around 18 years old, we'd been dating for about 8 months and I broke up with him because my parents were treating me differently
144	2	and I didn't like it.
144	3	It put too much strain on both my bf and I, and my parents and I's relationship
144	4	and I couldn't take it.
144	5	Broke up with him one night and about a week later he showed up at my parent's house wanting to talk to me.
144	6	My mom answered the door, I didn't want any part of it, so she told him to go away.
144	7	He got belligerent and eventually left, so she called the police.
144	8	He was pulled over, and given a warning, then they let him be.
144	9	Dad was at work, mom took sister somewhere, and I was playing Mario Party 8 on my Wii at home.
144	10	There was a knock at the back door and I look through the glass from the couch and he was there looking in trying to talk to me.
144	11	Again, I didn't want any part of it so I ignored him.
144	12	He got mad and shouldered the door.
144	13	The frame cracked.
144	14	He did it again and the door burst open.
144	15	I said, 'What the fuck are you doing?
144	16	' and he grabbed me and put me over his shoulder and carried me outside.
144	17	I figured he was just going to put me in the front seat and leave with me
144	18	but then he popped the trunk of his car with the remote
144	19	and I realized what was going to happen.
144	20	I twisted a little, which surprised him, and he dropped me, but then he put me in a headlock where I couldn't breathe and I stopped struggling.
144	21	He tossed me in the trunk and shut it and drove off.
144	22	At this point, I was doing everything I could to get out of the trunk ((It was a Buick Le Sabre; the model which, of course, doesn't have a way to open the trunk from the inside))
144	23	so I started kicking the back of the seats to get out.
144	24	I eventually got one open enough to stick my head through to get some air.
144	25	It was in August, and the temperatures outside were riding 95 degrees, so inside the trunk was about 110.
144	26	I got my head out and could finally breathe.
144	27	He had calmed down a bit, and I knew he just wanted to talk to me, so he didn't really freak when I was able to climb into the backseat.
144	28	When he was putting me in the trunk, the neighbor kids were outside and they saw what was happening and ran inside to tell their parents.
144	29	Parents called the police, police called my mom, and my mom was doing 95 down the highway to get home.
144	30	Ex-bf drove me an hour and a half away to an old camp he used to go to and we talked for a while.
144	31	He then took me to Pizza Hut cause I said I was hungry.
144	32	I remember wondering why no one was concerned that I was waiting for a pizza without shoes or socks on.
144	33	Because no one said anything, I figured my parents hadn't realized what had happened yet.
144	34	Little did I know, an Amber Alert had already been issued.
144	35	Anyways, he decided he didn't want to go to jail, so he was going back to his workplace/place of residence to get his shotgun.
144	36	When he got there, the cops were waiting for him and tried to taser him.
144	37	They missed and he jumped back in his car and did a backwards u-turn.
144	38	He started driving through the city at speeds of 60-85 MPH.
144	39	If you've never been in a high speed police pursuit, let me tell you; it's a rush.
144	40	Sooooo much adrenaline.
144	41	Anyways, he was going to get on the highway but the police had it blocked off with spike strips so he turned onto a backroad that dead ended.
144	42	He ended up crashing into a tree.
144	43	((I was in the front seat by this time.
144	44	)
144	45	)
144	46	The cops swarmed the car, pulled us both out, and since they didn't realize who we were, cuffed us both and put us in separate cop cars.
144	47	Once everything was situated, the un-cuffed me and put me in a police SUV and transported me back to the police station in my city.
144	48	Parents and sister were there, freaked out, found out I was ok.
144	49	The whole ordeal lasted around 10 hours.
144	50	Ex got 4 years and is now out of jail in a half-way house.
145	0	Everyone else has a shit story, so here's mine.
145	1	I was eating blazin' wings at Buffalo Wild Wings with a buddy.
145	2	Got about 4 in and my stomach and asshole were already on the fritz.
145	3	I told them I'd be right back, went to the dumper, and prepared for an acidic shit like no other.
145	4	Instead, this massive log like you've never seen emerges.
145	5	The bottom of it stuck to the back of the bowl, and the top end of this foot-long+ demon broke off of my anoose and audibly slapped the back of my ball-sac, leaving a shit streak exactly down the center of my nuts, coming to a rest in the bowl from one end to the other.
145	6	There, I said it.
146	0	Okay....
146	1	When I was 15 a group of us were sitting around my friends place watching movies when my friend Kyle suddenly stands up and says "I think I know where my mums dildo is.
146	2	" We all tell him that's gross and to sit the fuck down as he runs off to his mothers bedroom.
146	3	Sure enough he produces a large pink dildo in a damp plastic shopping bag.
146	4	Jokingly I say "I'll give you ten dollars if you deep throat it.
146	5	" Now we all were broke as hell, except Kyle.
146	6	He worked as an apprentice butcher and was the the only one with a job.
146	7	My point being he didn't need the money.
146	8	So he says "show me the cash", I produce the $10 and he goes to town on his mothers smelly, unwashed dildo.
146	9	Then promptly vomits on her expensive imported rug.
146	10	We all lose our shit, I hand him the cash and go back to watching the movie.
146	11	It takes about 5 minutes before he whips it out again and starts gnawing up and down the thing like a cob of corn.
146	12	I swear he must have gotten a taste for the thing.
147	0	I used to be an employee at Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle.
147	1	I was in high school at the time and I didn't have a car so my parents took turns taking me to work and picking me up.
147	2	One day my mom tells me that she is going to bring the two kids she babysits and have me give the three of them a quick tour around the highlights of the zoo before we go home.
147	3	After I finish my shift I meet up with my mom and the kids and I decided to take them to the tapir exhibit first.
147	4	The zoo's tapirs were a breeding pair and the female was pretty far along he her pregnancy.
147	5	As we approached the exhibit I explained how the zoo keepers were expecting the tapir to give birth any day now.
147	6	We reach the exhibit and one of the tapirs walks right up to the glass and suddenly something pink starts emerging from beneath it.
147	7	The kids point it out almost immediately and second by second its coming further and further out.
147	8	My mother starts screaming "OH MY GOD
147	9	THE TAPIR IS GIVING BIRTH!
147	10	OH MY GOD YOU HAVE TO GO GET A ZOO KEEPER THE TAPIR IS GIVING BIRTH!".
147	11	As a typical teenager I was easily embarrassed by my parents, but this was a new low.
147	12	A huge crowd almost instantly formed and my mom wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise.
147	13	I wanted to tell her that the tapir has the largest penis to body ratio of any animal in the world.
147	14	I wanted to explain that the tapir was just proudly sprouting a boner for the ever growing crowd to admire, but she wouldn't hear it.
147	15	I melted into the crowd and abandoned her.
147	16	Maybe I was a terrible son...
148	0	Posted this before in a similar thread that didn't gain traction:
148	1	Of course I'll preface this with the usual "I'm not a superstitious or generally spiritual person" but...
148	2	In high school I was in the drumline, and we usually practiced early in the morning prior to school starting.
148	3	We were inside the bandroom that day because it was fairly cold.
148	4	So anyway, I'm doing my thing, playing the tenors (toms for the layman) and I drop one of my mallets.
148	5	I turn to pick it up and I can't find it...
148	6	There is about ten feet of open bare floor surrounding me and nowhere to be found.
148	7	My instructor stops us and basically just asks me what the problem is.
148	8	So several of us start searching around, can't find it.
148	9	I say screw it and grab a spare set.
148	10	About twenty mins later, the band director walks in, unlocks his office, sits at his desk and knocks on the window, I look up and he picks up the mallet off his desk with a look like, "what is this doing in here?
148	11	" I could verify that it was mine because I marked each set.
148	12	Nobody had gone in or out, no gap under the door, locked room, ended up on the desk.
148	13	There were 15 of us in the room at that time and there was a unanimous "NOPE!!!!!!
148	14	" moment.
148	15	I was stunned and one of my buddies came unglued.
148	16	We pretty much canceled the rest of rehearsal right there and many of us were pretty bugged about it the rest of the day.
148	17	I couldn't concentrate on anything for almost a week after that.
148	18	Eventually my brain just filed it away under "unsolved mysteries" and I went on with life.
148	19	TL:DR - Playing drums, dropped stick, (edit: "it") ended up in a locked room.
149	0	Stuck my tongue out at a little boy who was playing peek-a-boo while sitting in a shopping cart.
149	1	He giggled, I smiled.
149	2	His mother came around the cart, got all up in my personal space and said that if I did it again she would call the cops.
150	0	Too late to the party, but I was walking home from the bar and I stopped at what I thought was a safe spot to squat down and do a pee in the bushes.
150	1	Obviously I had scoped out the spot poorly because not half way through my pee I looked up to my left and about 10 feet away was a homeless man.
150	2	We locked eyes while I was peeing.
150	3	He told me that we were lovers, I said "k".
150	4	He then told me he had been following me for the last six blocks at which point I cut the stream and pulled my pants up and started to walk swiftly to my house and then he said something referencing his genitals and I started to run.
151	0	My buddy Chris and I had been friends since we were about 12.
151	1	We grew up together in Castle Rock, OR.
151	2	He helped me through a really rough time after my brother died.
151	3	He was one of the most giving people I've ever known.
151	4	Not much was expected from Chris.
151	5	He came from a broken home with a sadistic brother and a father who beat him regularly.
151	6	None of us expected to make it out of our town.
151	7	It seemed impossible but Chris and I did get out.
151	8	He enrolled in the college courses with me, and although it was hard, he gutted it out like he always did.
151	9	He went on to college and eventually became a lawyer.
151	10	Last week, he entered a fast food restaurant.
151	11	Just ahead of him, two men got into an argument; one of them pulled a knife.
151	12	Chris, who'd always made the best peace, tried to break it up.
151	13	He was stabbed in the throat; he died almost instantly.
151	14	Although I hadn't seen him for more than 10 years, I know I'll miss him forever.
151	15	I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve.
151	16	Jesus, does anyone?
152	0	Back in the 70s, my mom found a bag in my room.
152	1	No one was around, so she figured she'd give it a try to see if it was as good as the hype.
152	2	She liked alcohol, and thought weed might be similar.
152	3	Sadly, she was prone to panic attacks at the best of times, and her first (and LAST!
152	4	) attempt at getting high provoked a real bad panic attack.
152	5	She was alone in the house and felt like she was going to die.
152	6	That made me kind of sad, when she told me about it years later.
152	7	She was nice enough to return the bag to where she found it.
152	8	:-)
153	0	Similar story with a violent twist.
153	1	I lived in your quintessential college apartment complex across the street from campus.
153	2	Random dog is running around the complex by the pool, no collar, nothing.
153	3	And its panting like a sonofagun.
153	4	So I brought it some water and some leftovers to munch on.
153	5	Happy dog.
153	6	We chilled by the pool with it for a while (turns out it loves swimming).
153	7	Well after about an hour, a gaggle of fratstars show up and make a bee-line for us.
153	8	I'm a civilized, rational person for the most part.
153	9	The ringleader walks straight up to me and says verbatim "What the fuck made you think it would be a good idea to throw my dog in the pool?
153	10	" "Uh, he was running around in here, panting, so I brought him some water.
153	11	Then I hopped in the pool and he jumped in too.
153	12	"
154	0	I had a tumor on my ovary that was mis-diagnosed, until one day it pretty much started to rupture (or whatever it is that tumors do) and I had to be whisked away, puking blood and all, to the ER.
154	1	The whole story is pretty amusing - it even involves vomiting on an old lady at Stop &amp; Shop - but I've been hesitant because I don't have any proof other than the scar on my stomach.
154	2	Hopefully Yale New Haven will send me the copy of my medical bills soon, because I feel like that'd be much better proof.
155	0	So I met this guy at a party for a friend of a friend.
155	1	I'm pretty shy
155	2	so I ended up kind of hanging out in a corner by myself and met a guy who was also a friend of a friend of the host.
155	3	He was pretty cute and funny
155	4	so we spent most of the night talking and the subsequent few days texting and calling each other on and off.
155	5	Finally, he invited me out on a date to go horse back riding.
155	6	Cool, I love horses.
155	7	I'm down.
155	8	We live in a bigger city so we have to drive for about 1.5 hour to get to the place where he boards his horses.
155	9	On the way there we chat and generally bullshit until we're about 15 minutes away, then he gets really quiet.
155	10	I take this as him getting tired of driving and just enjoy the music and scenery.
155	11	We get to the place and he literally hops out of the truck before he even puts it in park and RUNS towards the stable calling his horse's name.
155	12	I put the car in park thinking that it's been forever since he's seen her and he really loves his horse.
155	13	I follow him to where he goes and he's in the stable feeding her carrots and lovingly stroking her nose.
155	14	He gives me a carrot and shows me how hold my hand to feed her and instructs me to give her a carrot.
155	15	The horse eyeballs me, turns her head and walks away.
155	16	Whatever.
155	17	Whorse.
155	18	He loans me a horse to ride and we go on a mini ride and picnic.
155	19	Any time he got close enough to touch me or hold my hand his horse would "mysteriously" veer away from me.
155	20	After we're done we pile into the truck and make the drive home.
155	21	About a mile and a half from my exit, he asked me what I thought of his horse.
155	22	I said she was cool
155	23	and I thought she was beautiful.
155	24	Then he dropped a bomb on me.
155	25	He said he was having sex with his horse.
155	26	And that they were "in love".
155	27	The only reason he was dating was because he knew he was going to die before her.
155	28	He told me that if we were to date that I was not to make him choose because he would ALWAYS choose her first and that she was his priority.
155	29	In other words, I would be second fiddle to a horse.
155	30	I've had some pretty awful dates, but if I ever top that one I'm joining a convent.
156	0	Last year, a guy came to my house's door around 9:00 at night.
156	1	He knocked and I got my mom, and she went out to see what was up.
156	2	By the way, we live in a very rural area, so visits that late are extremely uncommon and strange.
156	3	The guy talked to my mom about how he was opening a business, asked whether she liked american-made products, then handed her a clorox container as a 'sample.
156	4	'
156	5	He went back to his minivan and opened it to get a 'vacuum cleaner' when my mom saw five other men sitting inside.
156	6	She told me to run and get my phone, since we don't have a land line.
156	7	I couldn't find it, so I got my knife and stood around the corner.
156	8	She threw the container outside and told them to get the hell off her property, as well as that she was calling the cops.
156	9	They peeled out of the driveway and we never saw the car again.
156	10	___________________________________
156	11	Oh yeah, a quick (and lighter-hearted) addition
156	12	Two months later my mom found a single, bearded guy putting filled garbage bags by the back door.
156	13	She asked him what the hell he was doing- he responded by saying "this is for your little girl" (my little sister).
156	14	Again, she told him to get the hell out, then went through the bags.
156	15	They were filled with garbage, dirty clothes, and empty tampon containers.
157	0	When I was about ten years old, my parents used to frequent this cheesesteak place.
157	1	I absolutely HATED their cheesesteaks and did anything to avoid going there for dinner.
157	2	One day my dad sent me inside the house with the food while he parked the car, and I took the opportunity to rip some cardboard off a box and put it in my steak.
157	3	I took a bite of my food at the table and pulled out the cardboard.
157	4	They thought some packaging had stuck to the steak when they were opening it at the restaurant.
157	5	Undeterred, I began to do this same thing every single time we got food from that place, and eventually my parents were fed up enough to stop going there.
157	6	Recently the place has been taken over by new owners, so my dad wanted to try it again.
157	7	No cardboard.
157	8	I considered telling them, but I refrained.
157	9	To this day I wonder if they knew that it was me putting the cardboard in the food.
158	0	I posted an absolutely insane (true) story involving an ex.
158	1	Based on that story, people were able to find news articles that listed her name, but not my own.
158	2	I got freaked out that people were so obsessive over finding more details so I deleted the post.
158	3	Then I decided to delete the account.
158	4	Just as I was about to delete the account, I received a direct message from someone who knew details that weren't available anywhere online.
158	5	He had also dated this girl, and he needed to talk to me right away.
158	6	My mind raced with possibilities.
158	7	STDs?
158	8	A child I don't know about?
158	9	Did she try to hire him to kill me?
158	10	Nope...he just wanted to talk to someone who knew her about what a crazy, crazy person she was.
158	11	I was disappointed.
159	0	My great-uncle Bob in his day was a trucker, and was passing through a bar in Utah with some friends.
159	1	In the bar, there were a group of men trying to prostitute an 11-year old.
159	2	Bob and his friends call them out on it, tell them that they better stop, etc., and it escalates to a fight in the parking lot.
159	3	The 'pimps' pull out baseball bats and beat my great-uncle and his friends over the head.
159	4	All of Bob's friends died, some instantly and some in the hospital.
159	5	My great uncle has never been right since :(
160	0	My grandfather owns several forests around the village he lives in, and he drives through them every week, to check how the trees are doing and wether something needs to be fixed.
160	1	He really loves his trees and has a sharp eye for any potential sickness or insect that could pose a threat.
160	2	A decade or two ago, hitchhikers were very common.
160	3	Even in the thinly populated areas of bavaria, he encountered them regularly, and was always happy to help.
160	4	He literally picked up every single hitchhiker he found.
160	5	One day however, he had a bad feeling about one.
160	6	Without any reason, he dismissed this one hitchhiker standing on the side of the path.
160	7	Later that day, there was a radio broadcast about a previously convicted murderer who killed someone in the woods and got caught trying to flee by hopping onto someones car.
160	8	Just writing this down makes me shudder again.
161	0	In Korea the toilets in more rural areas rarely have toilet paper.
161	1	I was 14 visiting family for the summer and had to drop a huge deuce.
161	2	It came out like gravy; and it was then I realized I had no toilet paper or paper towels in the bathroom.
161	3	Unlike American toilets, most in Korea are the squatters, like this so I couldn't use the toilet water to wipe my ass with my hands:
161	4	http://wanderingcanadian.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/squat-toilet-2.jpg
161	5	There were a shitton of people in the bathroom, and for some retarded reason I decided to use my umbrella I had because it was raining, and I figured the rain would wash it away when I got outside.
161	6	When I went outside my aunt grabbed the umbrella, which was the only one we had, and yelled at me for taking so long and opened it up.
161	7	Small pieces of my feces flew on my entire family like we were gingerly coated with brown pepper.
161	8	Needless to say I have never returned to Korea
162	0	Didn't happen to me, but a friend.
162	1	This is too good of an opportunity to pass up though.
162	2	So this girl friend of mine goes on a date with this guy we met in high school at a state cross country meet.
162	3	She figures everything will be alright, because she's known him for a few years.
162	4	They go out to dinner, and go back to her place to watch a movie, cause they're broke college seniors.
162	5	Anyways, while they're watching TV, this guy just looks over at her and says "Hey, do you mind if I jack off?
162	6	" At this point, they haven't even kissed or anything.
162	7	Not even held hands.
162	8	Just awkward sauce first date space between them.
162	9	Of course, she says no, you can't and laughs because she doesn't think this guy is serious.
162	10	Turns out, he was.
162	11	He just whips it out, and starts masturbating right in front of her - moaning and the whole shebang.
162	12	She laughs, because she's so very nervous.
162	13	To make it worse, it goes everywhere when he's done, including her hair.
162	14	She stood up, looked at him, and said "Can you please leave now?
162	15	" and opened the door for him before running to take a shower.
162	16	Apparently, he thought this was cool and said something along the lines of "I'll catch ya later.
162	17	"
162	18	Worst.
162	19	First.
162	20	Date.
162	21	Ever.
163	0	I work in retail because I need the health insurance, but a LOT of customers seem to believe I work where I do because I'm an idiot.
163	1	And the second something like that comes out of their mouths ("could you actually learn how to do your job CORRECTLY!?
163	2	Some of us have places to be, y'know, jobs that actually matter.
163	3	'')
163	4	I become the stupidest cashier you will EVER have.
163	5	My idiocy knows no bounds; even the mentally handicapped greeters at a Wal*Mart could do better than me.
163	6	What's that?
163	7	You're the shithead that brought in an expired coupon, and when I scan it and tell you it's not valid, I'M the stupid one?
163	8	Huh.
163	9	Okay then.
163	10	I guess I need to call over a manager to okay every single one of your coupons, you snotty twat.
163	11	Good thing you weren't in a rus-
163	12	oh wait, you're gonna be late to your doctor's appointment?
163	13	That's too bad, because I accidentally just deleted everything I rung up!
163	14	Gotta start over!
163	15	Note: I only do this to customers that insult me first, it's never unprovoked stupidity, and I don't do it if there's a line behind them, it wouldn't be right to fuck with innocent shoppers.
164	0	Similar story to OPs, and comes by way of my friend, who was an X-ray tech at the time.
164	1	Two guys come in to the hospital, one of them with a vibrator rammed in his ass.
164	2	As the doctors are figuring out what to do, the other guy is sort of whining about cramps he has too.
164	3	He's complaining, but being evasive, so it seems like he's trying to be an attention whore.
164	4	One of the docs tells my friend to run an X-ray to shut him up.
164	5	The X-ray done, my friend is standing behind this little curtain separating her from the patient and trying to process what she is seeing.
164	6	There are three perfect ovals in his bum.
164	7	As she tells it, it hits her and she lets out this surprised, "OH.
164	8	MY.
164	9	GOD.
164	10	"
164	11	They were hard-boiled eggs.
164	12	The guy starts giggling sheepishly.
164	13	She said they used something that dissolved them to get them out.
164	14	BONUS for the straight guys/gals.
164	15	Later, she said, med personnel are talking about the weirdest things they've seen in the ER.
164	16	One doc says a guy comes in bleeding profusely at the groin and the girl with him is bleeding from the top of her head.
164	17	Couldn't figure out how the hell these injuries came about.
164	18	Turns out, they were at a restaurant and the girl crawls under the table to blow the guy.
164	19	She has a seizure and clamps down on his manhood, all while her head is bucking against the top of the table.
165	0	Met a girl on OKcupid.
165	1	We decided to grab a burger in her area.
165	2	We met, chatted, ate, had a great time, found out we shared many interests, had a good laugh, very friendly and casual.
165	3	She then got really disheartened, started being very quiet.
165	4	I asked what was wrong.
165	5	She admitted she was a transsexual (honestly, you couldn't tell) male-to-female, and had no idea how to get into the dating world now that she was the gender she'd always felt she was.
165	6	I told her that I simply wasn't attracted to transsexuals.
165	7	We spent about twenty minutes apologizing to eachother and went our separate ways.
165	8	It's about two months later now, she has a boyfriend who she was completely honest with from the get-go, and we frequently hang out, play video games and watch cartoons.
165	9	...
165	10	yeah
165	11	that's my worst date.
165	12	Or most unusual date.
165	13	I don't date much.
165	14	I'm sorry reddit.
166	0	I dont know if this is "great", but I was sent to a disciplinary school in first grade, and before I was actually sent there I was taken to a psych ward to be "evaluated".
166	1	I was not told that I was being sent there, it was easy for them to deceive me because we actually had a relative in the same hospital who we visited before hand.
166	2	So we walk into this reception area through large double doors, my mom goes and talks to the guy there, then all the sudden the lady behind the counter offered me a lollipop.
166	3	I don't say no to lollipops.
166	4	Got it nearly to my mouth, looked back, most of my family is backing through the doors.
166	5	I scream, start bawling hystericly, and run full force at those doors.
166	6	They were remotely locked.
166	7	So I decided to headbutt the orderly in the groin and make a mad dash for the pencils.
166	8	I thought that if I had a weapon, I had leverage.
166	9	I succeeded in headbutting the guy, but it nearly knocked me out.
166	10	Apparently they wore cups.
166	11	So, the guy not down, I took a flying leap towards his face.
166	12	Then I learned why being that young sucks.
166	13	Picked my ass up and held me out.
166	14	Then he took me to a room and out me in a strait-jacket sort of thing, only I was on the floor and couldn't get up.
166	15	I remember thrashing around in it for an hour, then finally feeling my whole finger go through one of the Velcro straps, only for them to come over and readjust the whole thing.
166	16	After that shit gets a little foggy, but I remember one orderly who gave out biscuits with milk.
166	17	It pissed me off, made me feel like a prisoner (which I was), and so I stabbed him in the ankle with a broken off crayola pencil.
166	18	That was more time in the jacket, then I had to share a bed with some girl who had apparently never learned to control her bladder.
166	19	Joy.
167	0	Not as bad as your story.
167	1	I found an iPhone 3g at the Disneyland parking lot.
167	2	I kept it charged going home, no calls.
167	3	Woke up to it before work and let the owner's gf's know I had the phone and they could pick it up.
167	4	I gave them my number since I couldn't text out of his phone.
167	5	They kept asking me to leave work and drive 40 minutes out of my way to give it to them.
167	6	Finally they came to my work, I asked them to unlock it in front of me to verify ownership.
167	7	When I handed it back to them they said "Wasn't there a case to this?".
167	8	When I told them I didn't have it, the gf said "ok" and just walked off.
168	0	When i was a kid growing up in philippines, i developed childhood asthma due to the heavy pollution.
168	1	Even when we're barely scraping by, my mom would make the effort to bring me to a hospital for check-ups and when i get really weak, hospital stays.
168	2	she even did as far as buy a ventilator(?
168	3	) for me where you have the liquid medication and it changes it into vapors to breathe in.
168	4	This is always my companion since i dont have the portable asthma medications we have now.
168	5	Even with all that, my asthma still keeps getting worse and worse.
168	6	I remember having shortness of breath all the time to the point that i would be weezing not breathing.
168	7	So they decided to dabber in "alternative" medicine.
168	8	I would have sessions with quack doctors and magic healers.
168	9	I remember this one guy dropping candle wax in a bowl of water and "reading" my illness.
168	10	Yeah, i was very confuse of this as well.
168	11	we did novena's and prayer vigils.
168	12	i would always eat honey with garlic.
168	13	And then my parents decided i should eat cat ears.
168	14	I dont know how the idea came about, but my grandma in the province kept alot of stray cats so they cut off two ears of a cat, grilled it and fed it to me.
168	15	I don't know which of the many things i have used that healed me exactly, but now im asthma free.
168	16	I think it maybe the cat ears.
168	17	So after a couple of years later when we went to visit grandma, i notice a bunch of cats walking around the house.
168	18	I think i counted 7 of them.
168	19	there's one cat with both of its ear flap cut off and a couple more with a left or right ear flap missing with the exception of one cat having both ear flaps.
168	20	Just when i thought i only ate two ears, i guess i may have eaten more.
168	21	One of the most shocking things in my life.
169	0	I was traveling back home with my mom from my aunt's house on a warm, sunny afternoon.
169	1	While I was sitting in the passenger seat, an object just appeared in the sky a little to our left.
169	2	We both saw it immediately.
169	3	The size of it is what was shocking more than anything.
169	4	It had the classic saucer shape and was shining brightly because the sun was reflecting off of it.
169	5	We continue driving down the road a few seconds, just admiring this craft when all of a sudden we saw something I still don't believe to this day.
169	6	It just vanishes.
169	7	Disintegrates.
169	8	Disappears.
169	9	Whatever you want to call it.
169	10	I looked back at my mom and I could tell by her expression she had seen the same thing.
169	11	Since this sighting, I have always been interested in UFO's and the possibility of other life in our universe.
169	12	This object in the sky was definitely not a helicopter, airplane, or a flock of geese.
169	13	My mom and I still talk about the sighting we had and can't come up with a reasonable explanation as to what we saw that day.
169	14	This is my UFO story and it is not a hoax or fabrication.
169	15	Everyone always laughs at me when I tell this story, but that's fine.
169	16	I know what I saw.
170	0	Last night, I dreamt that I composed a Lady Gaga song.
170	1	It was amazing.
170	2	It was a bit of post-hardcore and symphonic metal.
170	3	Think Nightwish and As I Lay Dying- but Gaga doing the vocals.
170	4	It was awesome.
170	5	I even uploaded it on YouTube in my dream.
170	6	The song was called "troubled blue" Lower case "t," and "b.
170	7	"
171	0	We were partying at a usual party spot by the river, and some dude came out of the woods.
171	1	He just kept saying weird shit like "you gotta watch yourself down here," "There are some bad folks around here" and when asked who he was he just said, "I'm nobody.
171	2	" We were all a little sketched out, and basically told the guy to fuck off.
171	3	A couple days later a girl went off the rope swing there and got really fucked up.
171	4	Someone put fishing hooks all over the bottom of the rope swing and it took chunks of flesh out of her leg.
171	5	Later we found out the dude was just a guy that lived nearby and although a creepy drunk, he was harmless.
171	6	There was a fucked up, probably inbred family that lived up the road that he would warn people about.
171	7	About 5 years later, last year, they beat some kid up with a log and kidnapped some girl at gunpoint and took her on a joy ride.
172	0	So I totally deserved this but shit it was awesome/fucking terrifying.
172	1	I had hooked up with a girl (who we'll call Sasha) who lived out of town (2 hrs away) and when we went to visit she kept on complaining about her ex-boyfriend (the, don't put a crazy dick in you type).
172	2	They had been broken up for 9 months and he *still* kept tabs on her and got really jealous of all her boyfriends.
172	3	Being a complete troll I began texting him from her phone (with her permission) basically antagonizing him telling him that 'she was busy getting fucked from behind
172	4	so she couldn't text'.
172	5	Yeah.
172	6	Not nice.
172	7	I'm evil.
172	8	Feed me downvotes.
172	9	I hadn't even actually had sex with her.
172	10	Fingered but no penis.
172	11	Anyways one thing escalates to another and we decide to drive over to his house and just drive by for the thrill of it.
172	12	We are in a yellow VW Beetle that a friend of Sasha's had.
172	13	She drove standard which made it cooler.
172	14	But what would happen next made me forever love beetles, and the girl who was driving it even more.
172	15	Us driving bye royally pissed off this guy (with good reason).
172	16	When we were gone, he texted my friend (Trevor) saying a bunch of psycho shit, like 'I wanna play hide and seek ;)'.
172	17	Turns out his friend had a Suburban and they were out driving the town looking for us.
172	18	This was not a big town, and they eventually found us.
172	19	They began tailgating us and forcing us to speed up.
172	20	We were driving down a dirt road and they pulled up on the other side of the yellow line and tried to run us off the road.
172	21	GTA had prepared me.
172	22	I yelled HIT THE BREAKS!
172	23	We slowed and they zoomed by us.
172	24	We pulled into a storage unit type parking lot
172	25	but they looped back ridiculously fast and found us again.
172	26	We continued trying to escape and we drove into a subdivision with pretty wide streets.
172	27	They speed in front of us, and we think they are leaving.
172	28	Nope.
172	29	They pull a sharp u-turn and begin *driving backwards* in a come-at-me-bro fashion.
172	30	At this point somebody else sees whats occurring and calls the cops.
172	31	I'm on the phone with my other friend (who was getting laid at the time) saying how fucking crazy this guy is.
172	32	We pull into a side street and lose the guys.
172	33	When we go back to Sasha's house her lights are off but her front door is wide fucking open and nobody is home.
172	34	I still don't have an explanation for that, but the crazy ex wasn't there (at least when we arrived).
172	35	Me and my buddy (who was in the beetle with me) reconvene at Tim Horton's with our getting lucky friend.
172	36	We get the fuck out of town, and Trevor is still getting texts from the guy basically apologizing and saying he was joking about trying to legitimately fucking kill us.
172	37	The smilies he used were especially chilling.
172	38	Last laugh had by me: I went back a few months later and actually did have sex with her in the back of my car.
172	39	I didn't tell the dude about it.
173	0	When I was 6 I fell through the roof of my doghouse.
173	1	10 stitches to the satchel.
173	2	I still have a good scar on the back side of my ballsack.
173	3	I'm 22.
174	0	Okay this happened many years ago in my first apartment.
174	1	I lived with two guys, one of which was 21.
174	2	I was 19 at the time.
174	3	Anywho my girlfriend and a bunch of other people are over and we get wasted and whatnot.
174	4	Girlfriend and I go to bed at like 5am to do whatever.
174	5	Sometime that morning girlfriend wakes me up wanting to go out and get cigs.
174	6	I was in no condition to walk let alone drive so I mumble a no and promptly pass back out.
174	7	All of a sudden I'm being shaken awake by girlfriend who looks panicked.
174	8	She says some dude stole my car and crashed it into something.
174	9	I'm still barely coherent but I soldier and get dressed and stumble outside.
174	10	I look at the car and one of the front headlights is fucked up but by and large no real damage.
174	11	Girlfriend is still in a panic and cuts herself on the headlight.
174	12	By this time one of my roommates is out there as well and I tell him to take care of her cut while I look at the car.
174	13	All of a sudden I wake up again (yes I passed out on the ground in front of my car.
174	14	) to see a cop looking down at me from his squad car.
174	15	He starts asking me if this is my car and if I knew anything about it being crashed into an ATM outside of my local gas station (btw my gas station was in walking distance and I never drove there unless I needed gas).
174	16	He asks me to come with him to be identified at the gas station, I said ok
174	17	and I got my first and only trip in the back of a squad car.
174	18	We get to the gas station and the people there say it wasn't me.
174	19	We go back to my apartment and the cop starts asking me about my girlfriend, who I figured now that I was somewhat sober had taken my car to get more smokes and had crashed it.
174	20	At my apartment I find out that the girlfriend had bailed and was running around somewhere in a town she wasn't really familiar with.
174	21	The cops look around the apartment a little, luckily my other roommate hid the 4ft bong we had before they came in.
174	22	They do a check on my girlfriend and tell me she basically has a record already.
174	23	They tow my car and tell me I can come get it when I'm sober and I pay a ticket.
174	24	The cops finally tell me and my roommates to call if she shows back up.
174	25	Sure enough she walks back after like an hour.
174	26	We convince her to turn herself in and the cops come and pick her up.
174	27	Me being a broke as fuck 19yr old need my parents help in getting my car back which means I have to tell them an edited version of the above.
174	28	I broke up with girlfriend.
175	0	I let a girl crash at my friends house one night when she was black out drunk.
175	1	She showed up at the party drunk already after driving a good half hour.
175	2	Maybe 45 minutes in she passes out.
175	3	Carry her to a bedroom and put her in bed.
175	4	Get a call to days later, she's accusing me, my friend, and his dad of raping her and threatening a police case against her.
176	0	Okay here is mine
176	1	My good friend, band mate, and roommate at the time got invited to play a private party and Cheli's Chili downtown because our band played a lot of gigs at the one in Dearborn and we built up a relationship with them.
176	2	He was up on the roof playing and Cuba Gooding Jr., Kid Rock, Dave Cloulier, Jeff Daniels, Chris Chelios, a bunch of celebrities were there.
176	3	They were all digging it.
176	4	After a while Kid Rock is like "hey man, wanna jam?
176	5	" and my friend says "Sure!
176	6	" and gives Kid his spare guitar.
176	7	He was playing his Father's priceless guitar; the same one John Denver played.
176	8	Anyway, they played his Sweet Home Alabama song along with a few others.
176	9	Everyone was absolutely loving it.
176	10	Kid Rock says to him, "Hey man, do you mind if I jam on a few by myself?
176	11	" and my friend said "sure!?
176	12	" and went to grab a beer and shoot the shit with the hot shots.
176	13	After about 10 minutes my friend hears a crash and looks at Kid Rock and sees that he threw his father's guitar OFF OF THE ROOF.
176	14	He had some sort of rock star rage and threw it off of the roof.
176	15	So my friend ran over to him and questioned him.
176	16	"What the fuck man?!
176	17	What did you do?
176	18	That was my dad's guitar!
176	19	" and Kid Rock said something along the lines of "Go fuck yourself, kid.
176	20	I'm a rock star.
176	21	" (This is not a direct quote but basically what he said.
176	22	)
176	23	Anyways, my friend pushed him, then Kid Rock pushed him.
176	24	Chris Chelios came in and broke everything up and calmed Kid Rock down while Dave Coulier talked to my friend, trying to calm him.
176	25	After about 15 minutes, Kid Rock came over and apologized and said he was really sorry that he did what he did and said he would make sure to get the guitar fixed.
176	26	He reached in his pocket and gave him all of the money that he had on him ($1,400) and said he will get it fixed.
176	27	He also said he'd give him tickets and passes to his next show in Toronto in the following few days.
176	28	Kid Rock answered his phone one time and one time only when my friend tried to get the issue resolved.
176	29	He blew him off for an entire year.
176	30	Chris Chelios ended up stepping up and sending the guitar to Bob Segar's guitar tech who was too busy to fix it, so they sent it off to some other guy who fixed it.
176	31	Chris also bought him the guitar of his choice.
177	0	My dad was a cop.
177	1	His fuck it stories:
177	2	Pothead was ditching class.
177	3	Dad spotted him and gave chase.
177	4	They hit the woods.
177	5	Dad is not a fat cop, catching up.
177	6	In desparation the kid shucks off his $300 black leather jacket.
177	7	In my father's size.
177	8	Stops, collects jacket, and let's the pothead continue his terror fueled sprint through palmettos and spiderwebs.
177	9	Second story.
177	10	I forget the kids offense.
177	11	Probably fighting or pot.
177	12	Hot pursuit through the halls, up the stairs.
177	13	Kid charges toward the 2nd story railing and without pause, soars over the edge.
177	14	He hit the ground with a fucking stuntman roll, and came out of it running.
177	15	Dad didn't even bother trying to find out who the kid was.
177	16	In his words "It was amazing, that fucker deserved freedom.
177	17	"
178	0	Met a guy online.
178	1	Hit it off really well.
178	2	The date was going really well until my phone died and I got really nervous because my almost 3 year old was with a babysitter
178	3	and I was afraid she wouldn't be able to reach me if something happened.
178	4	We took separate cars to the bar we were at and I asked him if he would mind if I flew home real quick to grab a different phone.
178	5	I only lived literally 3 blocks away.
178	6	I left my leather coat just so he didn't think I wasn't coming back.
178	7	Of course I got a flat tire pulling out of my driveway on the way back.
178	8	My babysitter came out to help me change it and it took FOREVER cause neither of us had changed a tire before.
178	9	I was certain he would be gone by the time I got back.
178	10	But he was still sitting there waiting and there was a fresh drink for me waiting as well.
178	11	Two months later we moved in together.
178	12	One month later, he moved out.
178	13	We both just realized it was way too soon.
178	14	We are adults, both divorced....we just fell fast and thought we were kids again.
178	15	That was two months ago.
178	16	Surprisingly, we are still together.
178	17	Just decided to give it a bit more time before rushing into things.
178	18	But we are exclusive and I do feel like he could be the one.
178	19	I think realizing we moved too fast actually saved us.
179	0	I went shopping for a Halloween party with two friends from work.
179	1	At the grocery store, one of the girls lost her wallet.
179	2	We tore my car apart looking for it, went back in the store and looked everywhere.
179	3	We never found it.
179	4	Two days later I was back on that side of town and I decided to go in and check for it in lost and found.
179	5	We all lived pretty far from that store, and she had no means of transportation.
179	6	Someone had found it!!
179	7	So they let me take it to return to her.
179	8	Well, she wasn't too excited when I showed up at work with it.
179	9	She was acting weird.
179	10	I guess she and the other friend decided I was playing her the whole time.
179	11	Like I was hiding it so I could be the hero and return it to her.
179	12	Lesson learned.
180	0	When I was in 2nd grade, I was placed in this small advanced class called "Discovery", which was just 7 smart kids.
180	1	We did cool shit like make rockets and raise ducks.
180	2	Was awesome.
180	3	Come 5th grade, we get this young new teacher fresh out of college.
180	4	She was openly Jewish, and decided to spend the whole fucking year teaching us about the Holocaust.
180	5	Now, as a ten year old, I was noticeably upset about going from learning about bacteria to spending 2 months looking at pictures from Auschwitz.
180	6	Not that it wasn't valuable information to learn, I was just irritated that the program was no longer fun and sciency.
180	7	That shit gets depressing.
180	8	was no longer gruntled.
180	9	I voiced my displeasure, so she tried to have me removed from the program...tried.
180	10	Bear in mind that this was the late 90s, and this lady was completely computer illiterate.
180	11	One day before she came in the room, I put a couple dozen photos of Adolph Hitler I had downloaded for a report on her computer, like paintings that made him look heroic and glorious.
180	12	I then made it the default folder for her screensaver.
180	13	Unplugged the keyboard and mouse.
180	14	For the rest of that semester, she had to look at this slideshow that was basically an artistic blowjob to Hitler whenever she stepped away from her computer.
180	15	5th grade me did not fuck around.
181	0	I occasionally suffer from sleep paralysis.
181	1	It developed in my early twenties, and I've had the alien abduction dream.
181	2	My dad and I loved to watch shows about aliens, so I assume people who claim they were abducted had some form of sleep paralysis.
181	3	It started with flashes of blue light, and I felt myself being lifted out of bed by the chest.
181	4	I was blinded by a white light, and I could hear a loud mechanical whirring.
181	5	When I woke up, I was sitting up in bed with my chest stuck out.
181	6	My arms were holding me up.
181	7	The experience was the most intense sleep paralysis dream I've ever had.
181	8	I can see how someone else could have that dream, panic, and tell everyone about it.
182	0	In my early twenties I got a job cleaning up water and fire damaged properties from a buddy of mine.
182	1	I had been with the crew for about three months when we got called out to my first fire damage situation.
182	2	So, the boss calls us in to his office that morning and gives us the scoop.
182	3	This, he says, is a delicate situation.
182	4	The house that we're going to be clearing out is a murder scene.
182	5	It had belonged to an elderly woman who had sometimes rented out a bedroom to some drifter fellow.
182	6	Well, this drifter fellow had disposed of the old lady and locked hisself in this home.
182	7	After some days, neighbors called the police to report that this woman hadn't been seen so the police came by and knocked.
182	8	No one answered.
182	9	Then the bathroom blew up.
182	10	Apparently, the drifter didn't see many options left at this point.
182	11	So he emptied diesel fuel and gasoline into the bathtub and took a hot bath.
182	12	So, the Fire crew comes out and puts out this fire.
182	13	They sweep the house, find no survivors.
182	14	The Police crew comes out, they sweep the place, find all finds of melee weapons and crazyness strewn around the house, but no old woman homeowner.
182	15	The house gets boarded up and shut down for a month while they complete the investigation.
182	16	Then it gets reopened for family to claim whatever belongings they'd like to.
182	17	That's where we come in.
182	18	We get to be on site to move any contents out of the location back to our shop and clean the nasty sooty grossness off everything.
182	19	Then return it to this poor woman's family for them to remember her with.
182	20	So, this place.
182	21	Wow.
182	22	From the outside it looks like something out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
182	23	A broken chain link fence scarcely hiding a few scraps of grass in what was once a front lawn.
182	24	Broken concrete path leading up to a front porch with an honestly welcoming door mat.
182	25	Funny, that.
182	26	Now remember.
182	27	This place had been on fire in the beginning of May.
182	28	Then the electricity and gas were shut off, and it was boarded up for over a month.
182	29	Opening the front door to this place felt like breaching one of the seven seals.
182	30	If a house could be said to belch, this one did exactly that.
182	31	Fire, ammonia and rot.
182	32	So, onward we went with dust masks on, and flashlights/floodlights to help us through this place.
182	33	I saw some of the most disturbing things I've ever seen.
182	34	In the living room it was dark and cluttered.
182	35	I saw right away the baseball bats, axes and crowbars next to all the doorways.
182	36	That drifter guy was really just waiting for someone to come calling for him...
182	37	My buddy and I grab the couch to move it to the dumpster out front
182	38	and it starts to shake violently.
182	39	We drop the thing and at least 3 cats ran out of it and out the front door, followed by my friend and I.
182	40	Scared the shit out of us.
182	41	We get back in there and find that those weren't the only cats.
182	42	Feline carcasses in the bedrooms, in the kitchen.
182	43	There were meat hooks hanging from wires in the kitchen.
182	44	Nothing hanging from those, thankfully.
182	45	I'm fairly certain there was a cat in the crisper in the fridge, but it was more soupish than anything definable.
182	46	In the backyard and in the shed, cats and cats and cat shit and ugh what a horrible smell.
182	47	So.
182	48	We're clearing out this place, salvaging whats salvageable and disposing what is disposable when the poor elderly homeowner's elderly sister finds the missing homeowner.
182	49	In a chest.
182	50	In the bedroom.
182	51	Under some debris that the Fire crew created when they knocked the roof in.
182	52	Shit.
182	53	After that, we got to call it a wrap temporarily.
182	54	The Police crew got called back out again and we were called back 2 days later to complete the job.
182	55	I'm just glad that I wasn't the one who opened that chest.
183	0	I was bartending one evening and an African American gentleman came in.
183	1	He sat at my bar, ordered a pint of Bud Lite, and started watching the game.
183	2	After I poured his beer, I entered his name in the computer system as BL GUY, for Bud Lite Guy.
183	3	I never considered that he may not read it as such when I gave him his check.
184	0	I heard this story at my school that has become known as the "protein cracker" story.
184	1	This one kid years before my time was constantly picked on at lunch.
184	2	People would always come up and start eating his food.
184	3	So, one day he gets tired of being pushed around so he takes some crackers to the bathroom and faps onto a cracker.
184	4	He took it back, sat down and waited for someone to take the bait.
184	5	It worked.
185	0	I tried to take a wallet that I found to my nearest the police station, which was not near where I found the wallet - the clerk was really rude and wouldn't take it.
185	1	She told me to pull behind the next police I saw in the city I found it and give it to them.
185	2	(Uhh...no thanks.
185	3	) I told her I was going to walk outside and throw it in the trash if she wouldn't take it.
185	4	She finally sent a cop out to help me.
185	5	It was a huge hassle.
185	6	Next time, I'll just let the punk kids take the wallet instead.
185	7	:/
186	0	Do zilla-esque wedding planners count?
186	1	My mother-in-law was heavily involved in planning our wedding, for which I was very grateful.
186	2	She has tons of contacts in the local small business community due to being a small business owner herself, and loves planning/hosting events.
186	3	I can't begin to describe everything she did for our wedding day.
186	4	However, one of her less-than-stellar decisions was to hire (without previously consulting me) a day-of coordinator- basically someone whose job it is to supervise and coordinate all the vendors and events on the wedding day.
186	5	At first I was just mildly irritated to not have met this woman before a contract was signed, but I didn't care very much because it was a role that needed to be filled.
186	6	Then I actually met her.
186	7	She rubbed me wrong from the start.
186	8	For one thing, she kept confusing my mother-in-law with my actual mother, though both ladies were present and she was corrected multiple times.
186	9	Then she told me straight-up that I was being criminally inconsiderate of my guests by hosting an outdoor wedding- which was out of line regardless, but this was six weeks before the wedding and some shit just can't be changed, so why bring it up?
186	10	She criticized our food, my bridesmaids (what do you mean you're only having two and they won't match?!
186	11	), our music selections, and our choice of opting out of certain traditions like a garter toss.
186	12	She talked herself up plenty though-
186	13	how many lovely brides who were absolutely dependent on her, how she was the best in the business, etc.
186	14	It was quite clear that she would have preferred to plan the whole damn thing herself and resented me for not allowing it.
186	15	It was also quite clear that she held cookie-cutter wedding tradition on par with a religious experience and found me and my wedding plans to be heretical, and it was her duty to instruct me on the error of my ways.
186	16	I'm not going to lie, after that meeting I would have fired her myself if my MIL hadn't already signed the contract.
186	17	I didn't want her to be on the hook for any deposit, so I grit my teeth and figured all she had to do was show up on time and tell people where to go.
186	18	She never showed up to the rehearsal at all, which was in her contract.
186	19	She was late to the wedding (our best man's wonderful wife stepped up and filled in).
186	20	At the reception, she was again late, which meant my husband
186	21	and I missed most of the beginning due to being penned up inside the house waiting for someone to figure out what was going on.
186	22	She then proceeded to screw up every single part of her job.
186	23	She brought me a plate of food before the caterer was done setting up, and indeed before I was ready for it, which meant I had to go back and get the rest of the food (not like I needed a plate brought to me, anyway).
186	24	I had to give the bartenders their instructions because she neglected to do so.
186	25	She never told the DJ when to cut out our first dance song so it went on about three minutes longer than intended, into awkward territory.
186	26	She also told the DJ to queue up a bouquet toss when I explicitly told her it was not desired, leading to maybe the most embarrassing moment of the day for all involved, as none of my friends or relatives wanted to participate either.
186	27	Things she was supposed to set out, like our guest signing area, were set up by my mother and aunt after we arrived.
186	28	We had sparklers to light at the end of the evening that never got put out at all.
186	29	She couldn't even get the fucking cake right- and ARGUED with me when I politely asked the caterer to unbox the top, as that was the flavor I wanted to eat and it was made clear to her from our initial meeting that we had no plans to save the top.
186	30	I did, however, see her thoroughly enjoying our food and beverages as though she were a guest later in the evening.
186	31	The real kicker for me, though, is after telling me that my wedding decorations were cheap garbage, she tried to steal my paper lanterns the following day while she was watching my loving family disassmeble the reception site.
187	0	Ive been waiting for the perfect time to tell this story on here.
187	1	I was at a huge car show with some friends.
187	2	We were walking around admiring all of them and then I pointed ahead of us to a car we were approaching.
187	3	As soon as I raised my finger a bee landed on the very tip for my finger.
187	4	I exclaimed loudly, "look at that crazy thing!
187	5	" I kid you not there was a black midget with no arms standing about 5 feet in front of me.
187	6	Probably top three most awkward moments of my life.
188	0	I leased an apartment with my friend and his boyfriend.
188	1	I was the only one working a reliable job at the time, and as I should have predicted, he lost his job a few months in, so it was only two of us working.
188	2	This should not have been an issue, but our agreed deal was to each pay 1/3 of the rent.
188	3	They couldn't afford their 2/3rds, and since most of it was spent on liquor, D&amp;D paraphernalia, video games and who knows what else, I had to pay his portion of the rent (and sometimes his boyfriend's) for the better part of a year or find another place to live, of which I had none.
188	4	Long story short, I get fed up with their crap, their constantly leaving moldy dishes in the kitchen, entering my bedroom and stealing the food in my fridge (that got so bad I had to install a lock on my fridge, then they complained about trust), so I leave with three days left to the month.
188	5	They owe me collectively, $700.
188	6	It's been about 5 years
188	7	and I have never seen the money.
188	8	I'm the bad guy for leaving at the end of the month.
188	9	One by one, he turns the rest of our friends against me.
188	10	I'm better off; they were all terrible people.
188	11	I would rather have learned that without losing all the money while trying to help out a friend, though.
189	0	I had a plan to kill my mother but I never went through with it.
189	1	The story is she was a heroin addict that cleaned up her life and had actually become a drug and alcohol counselor when I went to live with her when I was 14.
189	2	By the time I was 16, she had started to abuse prescription drugs and our relationship was getting increasingly more abusive.
189	3	She would keep me up at night being loud and high.
189	4	Sometimes she'd wake me up at random times to cry and tell me she wanted to die, that her life was miserable, and apologize for being such a shitty mom.
189	5	Then in the morning, she would grab me by the ankle and pull me out of bed, yelling the whole time about how stupid I was and how ungrateful I was and how I was such a terrible kid.
189	6	Looking back, it was a textbook abuse.
189	7	One second she was telling me she was the only person who actually loved me, then next tearing me down, telling me I wasn't worth anything, that I shouldn't go to college.
189	8	She tried to convince me not to go to school, or work or to hang out with my friends.
189	9	She threw things at me, shoved me around, and would block the door when I tried to leave the room rather than fight with her.
189	10	After months of escalating behavior, not being able to sleep at night, not having any food in the house except when I would buy it, I snapped.
189	11	I started to plan her faked suicide.
189	12	I was going to feed her every pill in her pill box (literally a 10 gallon tupperware filled with pill bottles).
189	13	The reason I didn't try is actually because other people tried to kill her before and it didn't work.
189	14	Also, I wasn't really sure how I was going to get her to take all those pills without showing evidence of a struggle.
189	15	Eventually, I broke down and told my best friend what was going on.
189	16	She immediately told her parents and I went to live with her until I went to college.
190	0	As a kid I found a $1,000 lady's Concord watch lying in a parking lot.
190	1	I call the cops and turn it in.
190	2	The cop tells me to wait a week and then gives me a wrong name and an incorrect number for the Lost Property Department.
190	3	Long story short, my dad goes ballistic and we subsequently find out that the cop in question never turned it in.
190	4	Fast forward 120 days later
190	5	and I call the Lost Property Department to see if it was claimed.
190	6	I am told that it was not and that the watch was mine to pick up.
190	7	Phone rings a half an hour later and it's a detective who accuses me of stealing it.
190	8	My dad goes ballistic again.
190	9	The detective calls me back the next day and says that the watch was identified by a serial number and most probably stolen by a "Mexican maid".
190	10	He never apologizes for accusing me.
190	11	I'm also fairly certain that there was no serial number on the watch and that it was just another bullshit story.
191	0	Seventh grade Spanish test.
191	1	It's all quiet in the room.
191	2	I'm a long haired greasy socially awkward geek.
191	3	I feel a sneeze coming on but decide to hold it back so as to not draw attention to myself.
191	4	I try, but cannot contain the sneeze inside.
191	5	It takes the path of least resistance out of my body- my completely stuffed-up nose.
191	6	The sound is incredible.
191	7	The snot tent is amazing-fully formed spider web of snot between my desk and my face.
191	8	The classroom turns to look at me and sit in stunned silence.
191	9	After about ten seconds, the girl in front of me (the hottest 7th grader in school) says loudly "that's gross!
191	10	" Everyone laughs.
191	11	I try to disappear.
192	0	I still, to this day, do not know what the fuck happened.
192	1	I swear to you I was awake the whole time and experienced it in full consciousness.
192	2	However, I want to attribute it to dreaming but dammit to hell, I know I was awake...
192	3	I was just a boy, perhaps 9 or 10 years old.
192	4	My twin size bed lay in the corner of the room just down the hall from my parents bedroom.
192	5	Next to my bed, opposite the wall, was a window facing the backyard.
192	6	This window had blinds, then wood-framed windows, then a screen, and finally burglar bars.
192	7	It wasn't the best of neighborhoods, nor was it the worst.
192	8	One night, for no reason at all, I just woke up in the middle of the night.
192	9	I saw movement at the window, a shadow.
192	10	Suddenly a face appeared *through* the window.
192	11	It was my fathers face.
192	12	The same father that was supposed to be sleeping down the hall, and yet it wasn't.
192	13	He didn't just break his face through the glass...it was *through* the glass...as if he was immaterial though he looked solid as life itself.
192	14	He wore a black beanie and had his facial hair styled just like my fathers.
192	15	He looked around the room and turned to his right...to find me there, wide-eyed and freaked the fuck out.
192	16	When he saw me, it was that look that he had found exactly who he had been looking for.
192	17	He *walked* through the fucking...let me re-iterate, he *WALKED* through.the fucking.window!
192	18	He stepped through at which point I noticed he had a maroon long sleeved sweater and black pants.
192	19	It was what you would imagine a 70's movie burglar to look like.
192	20	He looked at me and gave me a very calm smile, a smile that said, "I'm was looking for you..." It wasn't malicious, wasn't friendly either, just a look of fact.
192	21	The way a doctor tells you, "Everything's going to be fine.
192	22	"
192	23	He takes a step towards me and I scream bloody fucking murder, "DAAAAAAAAAAD!!!!
192	24	"
192	25	This guy turns into, for lack of a better term, a stream of mist and like smoke streams into my white blanket.
192	26	The blanket blew up into the air a bit like a wind gusting underneath and settled back down.
192	27	Once it settled back down the white blanket...glowed.
192	28	It glowed with a magnificent and glorious brightness that didn't touch the walls or the room...it just glowed hardly an inch
192	29	but it was so bright and well...beautiful.
192	30	It felt like something *happened* to me.
192	31	As soon as I felt...*something* my father had run down the hall to my room in his usual garb, white socks and whitey tighties.
192	32	This had all happened in mere moments.
192	33	So my father comes into the room and looks around quickly, finds that everything is okay except that his son is sitting straight up in his bed wide-eyed and freaked out.
192	34	He assumed I had just had a nightmare and thats why I couldn't talk.
192	35	I couldn't talk because I don't know what the fuck happened.
192	36	He rubs my head a little bit and goads me back to lay down.
192	37	I lay down, relaxed, and VERY fucking confused.
192	38	My father kisses my forehead and says goodnight.
192	39	As soon as the sounds of his footsteps disappear back into his bedroom, my blanket blows back up again and the stream of mist shoots back out into the middle of my bedroom.
192	40	There he stood, the same man mimicking my father but in a different wardrobe.
192	41	The fucked up thing about this was that this time he had a different look on his face...a smirk.
192	42	A smirk that said, "I came what I needed to do, good luck kid.
192	43	You're gonna be alright, everything's going to be okay.
192	44	"
192	45	And with that he walked back out *through* the window and vanished.
193	0	Pfft my whole job is like this!
193	1	I'm an emt in Vegas.
193	2	Very rarely do I ever get a "thanks" or a smile of appreciation.
193	3	Most of the time it's "why aren't we at the hospital yet" or "you idiots have no idea what you're doing".
193	4	And then ocassionally we get puked or pissed on.
194	0	Not my personal story, but i'll share it...
194	1	I would have had a great uncle but he died in WW2.
194	2	My Grandma had two weird events she would talk about.
194	3	(We always assumed their were more but she wouldn't share and has since passed away.
194	4	)
194	5	This event happened after the war, but before the wall went up.
194	6	His body had been laid to rest in what was East Germany.
194	7	One night my Grandma has a dream about him, he tells her clearly that she is to travel to Europe and bring his remains home immediately.
194	8	This up set her greatly and against the wishes of the rest of the family (due to cost) she went and got his body and had it moved to the US.
194	9	With in days of getting him home, the wall went up.
194	10	(For those too young to remember the cold-war, it would have been impossible to get his remains or visit his grave once the wall went up.
194	11	)
194	12	Then later while my Grandma was traveling with my mother (mom would have been about 9) she had a dream about him again.
194	13	He tells her not to take their flight and again while everyone is telling her otherwise, she follows his advice.
194	14	(Keep in mind at that point in time plane tickets were not refundable and were a lot more money, vs the average income.
194	15	)
194	16	The plane crashed shortly after take off, no one survived...
194	17	Not really matrix glitches, but the other posts reminded me of this.
195	0	During my time at nautical college a big group of us went out on the town to get shit faced.
195	1	We'd had a really rough time with exams and that's what we wanted to do.
195	2	As the night goes on the flock of guys collides with a flock of girls from the same college and we all start to hang out together as one of the girls has been having a real hard time at home
195	3	so we all thought that having a massive group of people, going to all the same places, for this girl we didn't know just to cheer her up would be an awesome idea.
195	4	Towards the end of the night our collective flock has gone down to just a few and one of the best guys I'd ever met was really getting into one of the girls as they're tucked away quietly into a corner.
195	5	Thinking nothing of this I decide to leave the two love birds alone and make way for my own conquest.
195	6	As we're all leaving that last club, my friends girl starts to freak out in the middle of the street, nearly getting hit by a car and then falling flat on her face.
195	7	We're all wondering WTF and decide to make sure she's ok and ask her what's wrong.
195	8	She then starts crying and screaming that my friend had given her drugs, oh boy.
195	9	I'd only known this guy for a year but we'd spent practically everyday chilling out together and never once seen him do drugs of any nature.
195	10	In the merchant navy if you get caught with drugs in your system you're pretty much blacklisted for employment on a global scale so not many people risk it.
195	11	I tell my friend to just go back to the flat and I'd help out the girl that was freaking out, make sure she was ok as her friends were going nuts at the whole thing and started panicking.
195	12	Eventually an ambulance turns up and they take her away to hospital, one of the girls asks me to go to the hospital in a taxi while she went with the 'victim' in the ambulance.
195	13	At the hospital the victim girl is describing what happened in ever growing detail and all this just makes me sick to my stomach, the way she was telling things, the guy i was hanging out with all that time had been a date raper or something.
195	14	The girls mother is at the hospital when all this is coming out and decides to pursue this with the full extent of the law, the police get involved.
195	15	This next bit is from what the victims mother told me.
195	16	The next day the police decide to check out the security tapes at the nightclub to see what they can see.
195	17	It turns out the VICTIM girl was the one that pulled out the drugs and from the looks of the video tried to slip my friend a couple of "somethings" into to his drink!
195	18	BUT he caught her trying to do this and went off at her and he ended up getting the fuck away from there.
195	19	Now she's on her own and decides to pop the pills for herself.
195	20	A few minutes is when we would have all been outside.
195	21	It was the last time for a long time we did any favors for randoms!
196	0	Once, when I was eight or so, I was at an aquarium where they were hosting a dolphin show.
196	1	The trainers tossed a bunch of beach balls into the audience, and the kids that managed to snag a ball from the ground could go up on stage and touch the dolphins and shit.
196	2	I managed to grab one of the balls, but there was this younger kid who also wanted it, so, being Good Girl Galbinus, I gave it to her.
196	3	I didn't realize it was the last ball on the ground.
196	4	To this day I am still mad at myself for doing that nice thing for the little girl, **because I fucking love dolphins.
196	5	**
197	0	I didn't do a throwaway but one of my top comments was simply "ha"
197	1	I told one of my friends that I had gotten tons of karma off of a simple "ha" and he said that he had seen it the other day, looked up the post, and found my username and now he pokes me about all the stupid shit I write on reddit.
197	2	He's probably reading this right now.
197	3	Hi, Hayden.
198	0	Hope this doesn't get buried,first and probably last time i post this.
198	1	Was driving from Atlanta GA to Lexington SC with my GF to visit my parents.
198	2	I like to drive at night since there are less people on the road and I can take my time.
198	3	At around 3am or so we are making good time.
198	4	I had stopped at a gas station and picked up some coffee for us and we were due in in about an hour.
198	5	GF was sleeping soundly and I'm listening to a quiet radio humming away.
198	6	I start getting a little drowsy and take a sip.
198	7	Road was just as my coffee, no cars in sight except for a spotted few on the side of the road here and there.
198	8	In the distance I can make out what looks like a hitch hiker, or what I think is one, but can't really tell due to such low light.
198	9	As I get closer I start to notice other things, like how the person is kinda thin and tall and completly, for the most part, apparently brown.
198	10	I'm right up on this thing now, and at about 20 feet it turns around and locks eyes with me as I pass by.
198	11	This was no person.
198	12	And it is the most terrifying thing I have ever seen in my life.
198	13	It was a deer.
198	14	Or I tell myself it was.
198	15	I have seen deer stand on their hind legs to fight, but they still have deer posture when they do.
198	16	not only that, but I was watching this thing walk for about 30 seconds from first seeing it in the distance to passing it.
198	17	The posture it had was human.
198	18	Standard biped stance.
198	19	Arms back, chin down.
198	20	But the worse part was the eyes, or lack there of.
198	21	In their place were two large black pits, almost black-holish.
198	22	I'll never forget the stare down it gave me.
198	23	The instant I passed it I had the only panic attack I've ever had in my life.
198	24	I had to wake up my gf to keep calm enough to get to an exit with a large gas station a few miles away.
198	25	Like hell I was going off a ramp close to that thing.
198	26	After we pulled into the station I had a complete meltdown.
198	27	I started crying harder than I ever thought I could.
198	28	I couldn't talk, breath, or do anything but want to curl into a ball and cry.
198	29	After around 30 minutes or so, she finally gets me to calm down enough to tell her what happened.
198	30	While I don't think she believed what I think I saw, she knew that I was convinced and legitimately scared to death.
198	31	Every once in a blue moon I will dream about it and wake up crying or in a cold sweat, and she will tease me about it or roll over and ignore me instead of comforting me about the one thing that I've ever been terrified of.
198	32	But I know what I saw, and I know it will haunt me for the rest of my life.
199	0	When I finished university my boyfriend convinced me that we should backpack in Europe for a month before facing the real world of jobs and such.
199	1	At one point we were in Edinburgh, on the Royal Mile.
199	2	He is of Scottish descent, so he decided he wanted to buy a kilt in his family tartan.
199	3	His family was a smaller one, so naturally the tartan was "rare" and the kilt would be more expensive.
199	4	If I remember correctly, the price was around 350 pounds.
199	5	He was trying to decide if he really wanted to spend that much money (and leaning heavily towards buying the kilt), so I asked him when he would wear the kilt to get that much value out of it.
199	6	He looked me straight in the eye and said "I'll wear it when we get married.
199	7	"
199	8	He did.
199	9	*Whoops.
199	10	Wrong word.
200	0	I was driving back home to Los Angeles with a friend of mine after visiting family near Phoenix, AZ.
200	1	We were headed west on highway 58 just out of Boron, CA en route to Mojave to catch the 14.
200	2	It was night and we were jamming out to some music.
200	3	The next thing I know I'm waking up, looking around and realizing that I was pulled over on the side of the road and that aproximately 3 hours had passed.
200	4	My buddy was fast asleep
200	5	so I woke him up and we both kind of had a psychological meltdown.
200	6	After we calmed down a little we went home and never really spoke of it since.
200	7	I have absolutely no idea when or how we transitioned from listening loud music and driving down the road to waking up safe on the side of the road.
201	0	I fly a lot, and as such have what is called "preferred status".
201	1	Essentially this lets me board every flight right after first class boards.
201	2	One day in San Jose I'm waiting for my flight to start boarding.
201	3	I'm dressed in my usual business attire, reading a newspaper.
201	4	I notice the lady next to me is obviously having a bad day, and her ticket says she is Zone 4 - meaning she's not going to board until the very end.
201	5	This flight was full, which meant the last folks to board were going to get screwed out of overhead baggage space.
201	6	This lady had a rollerbag that I'm sure barely qualified as carryon.
201	7	This wasn't going to be pretty.
201	8	The crew announces that preferred customers can board, so I get up and ask very politely if the lady would like to board early.
201	9	She looks offended and says "Why would I want to do that?".
201	10	Starts laughing, looks at the folks seated around her like I'm crazy.
201	11	The lady next to her immediately jumps up and takes me up on my offer.
201	12	I take her through boarding and she gives me a polite thank you.
201	13	So 20 minutes later the flight is nearly full to capacity, overhead storage is gone, and I see the "offended" lady get on the plane with her rollerbag.
201	14	She goes down the isle, then back up, then down again looking for space.
201	15	When the attendant informs her she has to check her bag, she starts crying and saying something about having breakables in her bag.
201	16	The crew takes her bag and as she's walking back down the aisle to grab her seat she gives me a "fuck you" look.
201	17	I sure hope nothing in her bag broke.
201	18	Ok, I don't give a shit.
202	0	My wife was the opposite of a Bridezilla.
202	1	On the day of the wedding, we had the following "adventures":
202	2	* I forgot the carefully made up wedding programs and the bubbles at the hotel.
202	3	* There was a mix up with the rings, and almost didn't have them in hand by the time the priest called for them.
202	4	(They were in my wife's mom's purse at the back of the church.
202	5	- My sister got them during the ceremony and handed them to the best man about 2 minutes before the priest asked for the rings.
202	6	)
202	7	* Between the wedding and reception, my wife got grease from the door of the antique rolls on her dress as we were getting out for pictures.
202	8	* My wife had an allergic reaction to the shrimp during the reception, and broke out in hives all over her face.
202	9	We had a couple doctors in the place, so we got a some benadryl and an epipen for the honeymoon.
202	10	* In an effort to maximize honeymoon time, we got a 6:00 am international flight to cancun the day after our reception that ended at 12:00.
202	11	That meant we had to be there at least 2 hours early and the airport was about an hour from home.
202	12	We got less than 2 hours of sleep that night:)
202	13	And through all this, she smiled and was positive and still views it as a perfect day.
202	14	Even when she was sitting in the bridal suite covered in hives from the shrimp, she just didn't want people to fuss with her, she just wanted to go back out there and have fun and dance.
202	15	She had never really reacted that way to shrimp before.
202	16	It has only happened a couple times since.
202	17	The allergist tested her negative for shellfish allergies, but said somethings trigger allergies you don't normally have, like stress or vigorous activities such as running or dancing)
203	0	My friend got a DUI when we were still in highschool.
203	1	He got his car taken away, he cried about it with his girlfriend there.
203	2	I felt super bad so I offered to sell him my bike for the $20 it would cost to fix the tire.
203	3	He gave me $20 and it cost $15 to fix the tire.
203	4	He says thanks.
203	5	The next week I see he's got a new bike, he sold mine and bought a better one.
203	6	We aren't friends anymore - after more bs like that.
204	0	I was eating popcorn in front of the TV and dropped a piece.
204	1	When it should have hit the ground, I heard a faint "pop" noise.
204	2	My mom was a stickler about messes, so I looked all over, under the couch, under the TV stand, everywhere, and couldn't find that popcorn.
204	3	About a year later, I'm watching TV again, and I hear the same faint "pop".
204	4	I look down, and right between my feet, is a freshly popped kernel of popcorn.
204	5	I picked it up, and it was still warm.
204	6	I'd been sitting there for at least an hour, and there was nobody else in the room.
204	7	Quantum popcorn.
205	0	When I was in the Army, my barracks room mate loaned his car to another guy to drive into town.
205	1	We were on a week of 14 hour shifts, and he wasn't going to be needing his car anyway, so he said he'd get the keys back from him at the end of the week.
205	2	So eventually Carlos (my roommate) tracks the guy down and says "I need to get my keys back from you".
205	3	The guy tells him "oh your shitty car broke down, so I had to leave it and take a bus back".
205	4	Carlos says "uh...ok...so where is my car?
205	5	" The guys says "How should I know?
205	6	probably towed by now".
205	7	The guy couldn't be bothered to TELL Carlos that his car broke down, couldn't even be bothered to make a note of where he'd left it (I dunno, downtown somewhere...), and actually blamed Carlos for his shitty car wasting his time.
205	8	The kicker was Carlos had just bought the car and the signed title was in the glove box.
205	9	He had no idea what the license number was, or VIN, and the car wasn't registered in his name yet.
205	10	He never got the car back.
206	0	I told my friend, a redditor, this story and he immediately told me I could get a lot of karma from it, so here goes.
206	1	I was in 4th grade and playing during recess.
206	2	The monkey bars were my forte, but I was unfortunate this day.
206	3	I don't really remember what happened, but I slipped and fell.
206	4	I landed on my butt pretty hard.
206	5	As I was rubbing my sore ass, I felt a huge tear in my pants right on the crack line.
206	6	Somehow I tore a hole through my pants AND underwear.
206	7	My classmate who saw this, could NOT stop laughing.
206	8	He at least loaned me his sweater to cover my ass for the rest of the day.
206	9	When I got home from school I threw away that pair of pants and whitey tighties.
206	10	Now, I'm not sure what happened, but this is what I assumed happened.
206	11	My mom must have seen my pair of pants in the trash and thought "wtf is my kid doing wasting his uniform pants" and not noticing the hole, placed it back into my uniform rotation.
206	12	The next day, I got through half of the pledge of allegiance before the teacher took me outside and explained how all the other students were staring at my ass.
206	13	I was seated at the front, soooo HOORAY for me.
206	14	I was sent to the nurse's office for some reason.
206	15	I had to wear a "loaner" pair of pants the rest of the day.
206	16	These things were fucking disgusting.
206	17	I threw another pair of underwear that day, they developed the weirdest musk from those pants.
207	0	My high school "girlfriend" told me she had cancer after our first date.
207	1	She asked me not to tell anyone and that her parents got really upset if it was mentioned so to not talk about it with anyone.
207	2	I dated her for six months.
207	3	She turned herself anorexic to appear "sickly".
207	4	Once I started making friends, no one understood why I was with her and I kept her secret.
207	5	Well, I finally put two and two together after she told me she was going in for chemo on a Monday.
207	6	She said she wasn't going to be at school for at least a week.
207	7	I caught her trying to hide from me before the first class and asked her how her chemo went.
207	8	She said it went so well and that all her hair fell out but they sewed it all together and sewed the wig to her head.
207	9	Yeah...
207	10	She was a special one.
208	0	I have two:
208	1	My first is not that embarrassing, but I feel bad for my mom.
208	2	I was around 7
208	3	and I had finished eating a fairly large burrito at a fine Spanish establishment.
208	4	I live around half an hour away from the restaurant, and needless to say the burrito worked its way through my pre-pubescent bowels quite quickly.
208	5	With 20 minutes till we are near our home I start to get the gas and stomach rumbles.
208	6	I inform my mother that I am going to be in need of "the facilities" soon.
208	7	Unfortunately for me, she does not stop along the way.
208	8	Eventually I get home squeezing by cheeks for all they've got while doing my "poopie dance.
208	9	" As soon as my mom opens the door I make a dash to the bathroom only to stop mid-way in the center of my living room.
208	10	I look back at my sister and mother still in the doorway and give an apologetic look.
208	11	Than I let loose.
208	12	I push out, I swear, to be a 6-8 inch turd out of my pants and onto the floor; a solid log.
208	13	I apologize to my mother as she cleans it up, and all is well.
209	0	When I was about 9 years old, I had to take a big shit at the beach.
209	1	I ran to find the bathroom but couldn't find it, so I went to the water (full of people), took off my trunks underwater and shit.
209	2	Felt good, but I didn't finish.
209	3	I was worried someone might notice, or grab hold of my dookies somehow.
209	4	I got out and was running around looking for the restroom when I asked some guy where it was, and I was a couple steps away it.
209	5	I walked in, walked out.
209	6	Barefoot in a public restroom?
209	7	Fuck that!
209	8	I pulled my trunks off and took a shit right in front of the entrance where nobody could see me because there were walls hiding the entrance.
209	9	It was shaped exactly as a toy poop.
209	10	Mission successful!
209	11	-This wasn't posted by the owner of the account
210	0	This happened to me in third grade, and it scared me so much I started crying and had to go to the office to talk to the principal about it.
210	1	I was in the hallway for misbehaving, and my neighbor Tad (a year younger than me) came walking out of a class to my right, passed in front of me and headed down some stairs.
210	2	We said "hi" to each other.
210	3	About 20 seconds later, he walked out of the same class, passed in front of me, and headed down the stairs.
210	4	I just stared at him, confused and afraid, and he looked back like "why the f are you looking at me like that".
210	5	I never realized how much it was like Matrix deja vu.
211	0	I remember one where I was the nopee.
211	1	A call came across the radio for an accident where both parties were now fighting and getting confrontational with the officer who had come on scene.
211	2	So my partner and I roll over we get both parties separated and it's obvious the one driver is DUI, so we hand her off to another officer to be arrested.
211	3	And he proceeds to hand us the drivers passengers: four 5-8 year old girls and one full on baby.
211	4	I will never forgive that sneaky bastard.
211	5	So we arrange for another caretaker to come get these little moppets and bundle them into the back of our car.
211	6	Well you'll be shocked to learn that the children of mothers who drive drunk are not the most well behaved little angels.
211	7	Plus the baby has began just wailing at the top of its lungs.
211	8	So, my partner takes the baby and a bottle he's salvaged from the crash in an attempt to calm it.
211	9	I'm in the driver's seat trying to separate 4 screaming monsters through a partition.
211	10	Also I don't know any names so it was a lot of "Abigal, is it Abigal?
211	11	Stop pulling.....Sara's?
211	12	hair!
211	13	Zoey?
211	14	Don't touch that a taser is not a toy!
211	15	" and so on.
211	16	At about this time our supervisor rolls by the scene.
211	17	He pulls up next to the car takes one look at the baby snuggled quietly in my partners arm as he coos to it; then turns to me as I'm trying to separate two pony tailed badgers in Icarly shirts - damn near losing an eye.
211	18	I could physically see the 'Nope' pass across his face and he drives away without a word.
212	0	Back in sixth form days we had a leaving do, and while I was there a girl i kind of knew got completely smashed.
212	1	Off her face.
212	2	She could barely stand, vomiting everywhere the lot.
212	3	I spent that entire evening looking after her, my friends all walked off, and made sure she got home safe.
212	4	My night was ruined but I thought it was good that I had helped someone.
212	5	Return to sixth form for a few days, and everyone thinks i did sexual things to her and treated me like dirt.
212	6	Lost the leaving night and everyone's respect for making sure a girl didn't drown in her own vomit.
213	0	I had a friend lose his phone in Ottawa/Gitineau after a night of drinking.
213	1	Once he realized he had lost it we tried calling it.
213	2	Fortunately a Good Samaritan had found it and answered our call.
213	3	He said he would be happy to meet us and deliver the phone and my friend said he would buy Mr.
213	4	Phone Finder a beer if he did.
213	5	Unfortunately one of our group had a bit too much to drink and grabbed the phone from Mr. Lost Phone and starts creaming into it "You fucking thief!
213	6	When I find you I'm gone kick your ass.
213	7	Mr. Lost Phone grabs the phone back and tries to apologize but Mr.
213	8	Phone Finder is not pleased and replies "You can pick your phone up at the bottom of the Rideau Canal" and hangs up.
214	0	Back in in Spring of 1997 a group of us neighborhood kids were looking up at the night sky observing the Hale Bopp comet.
214	1	I grew up hours from any major city so the view was pretty clear.
214	2	After while we started to notice a red and a white dot circling around each other making sudden movements in every direction.
214	3	Like no aircraft I have ever seen or have ever seen since.
214	4	At a certain point they merged into one craft then shot out three smaller crafts.
214	5	Although we couldn't tell whether it was a craft because they just appeared to be balls of light.
214	6	This went on for a couple hours.
214	7	Right before the lights disappeared they accelerated at lightening fast speed into the darkness.
214	8	We all went home terrified of what we saw.
214	9	The next day on the front page of our small home town paper it said it received several calls, the explanation they gave was that the local airport was testing aircraft.
214	10	I'm sure how much I believe that story because of what I saw.
214	11	To this day whenever I see my friends that were there that night we'll sometimes talk about it.
214	12	None of us can be sure what were saw but to this day none of us have ever seen anything like it.
215	0	I feel sorry for the people who marry bridezillas, and those who even have to be around and deal with them.
215	1	I am getting married in a month and my fiance is the furthest thing from a bridezilla, which I am very happy about.
215	2	Her mom and grandma are worse to deal with than her.
215	3	We both have been super laid back about the whole planning process.
215	4	Honestly I dont get what all the hype about weddings are.
215	5	You are getting married, isnt that the idea...not showing off.
215	6	If something goes wrong, so be it, its life, nobody is perfect.
216	0	Wow ....
216	1	I have a similar experience to this.
216	2	It was out of character for me to do this but there was an popular online game called Ragnarok.
216	3	There's has been multiple free servers and there was one server which I played on it constantly and then one day, i was really bored and I decided to make a girl account.
216	4	At first, few days as it went wasn't so bad then people started to hit on me left and right.
216	5	Tired of the typical response of, "sorry, I am a guy" then it would be followed by "eww, you fag!
216	6	" or "why are you playing as a girl?!
216	7	" or whatever.
216	8	I decided to make up an identity behind the girl characters, I was known as Jeanette "Janie" Southsworth to the players.
216	9	As I played more, the more popular I get and I do not know why.
216	10	I guess it was because I had good gears and i played good
216	11	and so on
216	12	but I was known as the Good Chick.
216	13	Some people even went as far to ask my e-mail which I quickly created one up at AOL.
216	14	It was one of those typical girly e-mails like, "RagnarokBarbieXOXO" so I gave it out to the guys who asked.
216	15	It then progressed to them asking for some pictures so I just did a quick google search and find the one at very last few pages to not arose some suspicions and emailed them.
216	16	As a result, I get "OMG!
216	17	YOU R SO HAWT!
216	18	I FAPPED!
216	19	" .
216	20	I was a little creeped out
216	21	but i brushed it off since it wasn't technically a picture of me that they fapped to.
216	22	So few months went by and I received my first nude picture from a guy.
216	23	That was when I knew I just had to stop but there was a fanbase based on Janie
216	24	so I started to pretend that Janie was too busy to focus on the game, too much schoolwork, have to take care of her new twin sisters named Bella and Eliza, then I gradually made her have to ditch the game to focus on her schoolwork so she can go to a college.
216	25	I got SO many e-mails saying for Janie not to abandon it, it wrecks my heart because I have made some good friends through her
216	26	but i just had to let it go once I realized that they were just her online friends and they would forget about her as soon as a new girl show up in the game.
216	27	I never went back to playing it.
217	0	This one has haunted me for years...
217	1	It was the first week of tenth grade, and I was new at my high school.
217	2	My other new kid friends and I sat down at a table in the cafeteria, and another new girl sat down with us.
217	3	She was in a wheelchair.
217	4	So I expected her to be really timid and introverted, but she was actually sarcastic and funny, introducing herself and making jokes about being in a wheelchair.
217	5	Example:
217	6	&
217	7	gt;Her: "I'm trying out for field hockey!
217	8	"
217	9	&
217	10	gt;Me: "Wait, really?
217	11	"
217	12	&
217	13	gt;Her: "Hahaha no you idiot, I'm in a wheelchair.
217	14	"
217	15	Eventually one of my friends boldly asks her about how she ended up in a wheelchair.
217	16	She says it was cancer.
217	17	My friend asks which kind.
217	18	She responds, "Leukemia, have you heard of it?
217	19	"
217	20	Now, bear in mind, she was funny.
217	21	She really was.
217	22	And cmon, who hasn't heard of leukemia?
217	23	So my gut reaction to her response was that it must be a joke.
217	24	I mean, everyone's heard of leukemia!
217	25	It was too late.
217	26	I burst out laughing.
217	27	I immediately realized what had happened and tried to cover it up by gasping.
217	28	It only made it worse.
217	29	Everyone at the table glared at me.
217	30	I spent the rest of lunch in absolute silence, and I never spoke to her again.
218	0	Two young kids are upstairs in their room, playing their playstation.
218	1	All of a sudden they hear their mom's voice angrily calling for them from downstairs.
218	2	They're confused because their mom rarely if ever gets angry at them, and they tell her they will come in a minute.
218	3	They keep playing, but she screams out again telling them to come right away.
218	4	They get up and start walking towards the stairs, when their mom appears in a crevasse in a wall, quickly pulling them in and covering their mouths.
218	5	Scared, she puts her finger to her lips and tells "it's okay,
218	6	I heard it too.
218	7	"
219	0	I was dating a girl... lets call her Rikki.
219	1	We had been dating for like 6-7 months, and we were at the stage where she was giving me head, but I was never allowed to go anywhere near her vag.
219	2	Whatever, it was all good.
219	3	Anyway, we were on vacation with a bunch of people (both her friends and mine) and we had separated during the day to hang out with our own friends and do our own thing.
219	4	So whatever, we get together for dinner, and end up going to her room.
219	5	She starts blowing me, and shes got this big smile on her face so I think all is well... nay nay.
219	6	Suddenly, I notice something is different.
219	7	I feel something is wrong.
219	8	Theres a little bit of teeth in this bj.
219	9	So I say, woah woah, easy there, I don't like teeth, and she stops.
219	10	Things continue, and suddenly theres more teeth, so I stop her and say that I'm not comfortable with this, I don't like teeth.
219	11	So she apologizes profusely and swears it wont happen again.
219	12	I shouldve trusted my gut that she was lying.
219	13	So we continue, everything is good when suddenly I feel a draft down there.
219	14	I look over, and her mouth is wide open.
219	15	Before I can move out of the way- CHOMP.
219	16	Naturally, I screamed bloody murder, and looked down to see my heavily bleeding member go limp.
219	17	So I scream at her, asking what the actual fuck she was thinking, and she goes "Maybe you shouldve spent he fucking day with me"
219	18	Needless to say, she was bat shit insane.
220	0	That's incredible, and my story definitely doesn't beat yours, but maybe it will make you feel a little bit better.
220	1	When I was senior in high school, I chaperoned a middle school trip for my church, and for a few days everything went better than expected.
220	2	The day before we left my stomach started to feel a little queasy, but as I was not in a situation to deal with the problem, I gritted my teeth and waited.
220	3	Over an hour later I can finally access the bathroom, but i have some 100 yards between it and me.
220	4	I know I can make it, I know I can make it.
220	5	I couldn't make it.
220	6	15 feet from the door everything went to hell.
220	7	About an hour later I walk out of the bathroom wearing pants that were not my own.
220	8	As you can imagine word spread like wildfire.
220	9	Like I said, not nearly as bad as yours.
221	0	This will probably get buried ..
221	1	When I was around 20, a few years ago, I kept having dreams about a woman with long black hair named Aroura [ pronounced A-roar-uh) .
221	2	They were different dreams but for some reason, her distinct face and name always ended up in them.
221	3	It got to the point where I would wake up frustrated and confused, trying to google her name or find out how I was connected to her.
221	4	After a few months she stopped showing up and I dismissed it, thinking my brain was just being a "scumbag.
221	5	"
221	6	Fast forward a few years later, Halloween 2009, I'm in the car with a friend stopped at a gas station.
221	7	I'm about to pull out and merge onto a highway when I get a phone call from a random number, so I stop the car but no one answered.
221	8	There was a person behind me who grew impatient, honked at me, and then swerved in front of me instead of waiting for 2 seconds for me to move.
221	9	Second they get on the highway, some silver civic loses control of their wheel and crashes into the car that swerved in front of me.
221	10	I called the cops and waited at the gas station for them to come.
221	11	Turns out the drivers of both cars died.
221	12	It 100% would of been me if I hadn't of got that phone call.
221	13	Called it back a few hours later out of gratitude and curiosity, rang 3 times and went to voicemail.
221	14	"Hi, you've reached aurora, please leave your name and number.
221	15	" Never had goosebumps like that in me life.
221	16	Called it again the next day, because I was that confused about the whole situation..
221	17	Some woman answers, we get to talking, I tell her my entire story including the dreams I had.
221	18	She tells me she doesn't know how I got her number and that she never called me as far as she remembers.
221	19	Weird.
221	20	Ask her if she has a facebook to confirm if she is in fact the woman in my dreams.
221	21	Check her facebook, holy fuck, it's her.
221	22	If that's not a glitch in the matrix then I'm just bat shit crazy.
222	0	This is a story about the first time I got high.
222	1	It was my freshman year of college (University of Wisconsin- Madison, if you need to know), and it was the Thursday before Halloween.
222	2	I had smoked some before, but it never really affected me much.
222	3	That night, a bunch of guys on my floor were going to smoke weed out of a vaporizer.
222	4	I had heard that a vaporizer gets you much higher than a pipe, so I thought, This will probably work.
222	5	*
222	6	We (Probably around 6-8 of us) all sit down in one guy's room, and we start passing it around.
222	7	A little after we started, I thought, *I should order a pizza to commemorate the occasion.
222	8	I haven't had a pizza in like 2 days.
222	9	* We keep passing it around.
222	10	About half an hour later, we're still going, but a bit slower, and the pizza has arrived, so I start eating.
222	11	Now, I'm pretty thin, but I'm 6'5'', and I guess it took a little longer to set in.
222	12	Toward the end it was just me and probably 2 other guys taking hits.
222	13	Eventually, still feeling relatively sober, I decide to devote myself to the pizza.
222	14	Somebody said something, which I didn't remember half an hour later, so I sure as hell don't remember now.
222	15	Whatever it was, my mind told me: *John.
222	16	That thing he just said?
222	17	WAS REALLY FUCKING FUNNY*
222	18	I start laughing.
222	19	I continue laughing.
222	20	Somewhere, a voice in my head says *Dude, you've been laughing for a while now.
222	21	Maybe you should stop.
222	22	* That was followed by a chorus of *FUCK YOU LAUGHING IS AWESOME LET'S LAUGH FOREVER HAHAHAHAHAHAHA*
222	23	Somewhere in there those around me notice this never-ending cascade of mirth, and they say: Fuck, John's really high.
222	24	That just makes me laugh even harder, we're talking [Joker-after-he-gets-handed-a-mirror](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiAonyJIV_A) laughing.
222	25	Eventually, I make my way back to my room.
222	26	I may have flown.
222	27	I was that high.
222	28	Back in my room, I get the idea to play some Bioshock.
222	29	Now, while I was familiar with the story, and had played the first few levels, I had never actually beaten the game before.
222	30	Earlier that day I had borrowed the game from the guy whose room we smoked in.
222	31	I had gotten past the introductory level before I went to get blazed.
222	32	Those of you who have played the game will remember that immediately following the intro level is the Medical Pavillion.
222	33	Murderous doctors, blood on the walls, people jumping out of morgue drawers-
222	34	it's some freaky shit *normally*.
222	35	However, I wanted to play Bioshock, and I would, goddamnit.
222	36	So I start playing.
222	37	Having played that level before about 2 years previous, I probably seemed oddly proficient for being baked beyond belief.
222	38	So at one point, I decide to listen to some music.
222	39	I thought, *Self, what would be some good music to listen to?
222	40	* And I answered, *Alan Parsons Project.
222	41	*
222	42	It was that strange combination that resulted in the strangest feeling I have ever experienced, until that point and since.
222	43	After what seemed like 3 hours, I checked my phone to see that it had only been 5 minutes.
222	44	Later, I would refer to that experience by "I stopped feeling time.
222	45	" I was on Skype at one point, and described it to a friend I had known since 1st grade as "beautiful and terrifying.
222	46	" She has not let me live it down.
222	47	Then came the climax of the whole affair.
222	48	For some reason, my door was open, and had been open.
222	49	Now, at this point, it's important to know that UW Madison does not take Halloween lightly.
222	50	Had I been more socially connected, I probably would've gone to a Halloween party that night.
222	51	And that was (presumably) led to about 5 girls who might've been from my floor walking into my room dressed in skanky costumes.
222	52	First thought, which later I found out I had said out loud: *Is this a dream?
222	53	* Second thought, which I did **NOT** say out loud: *Fuck, I'm really high*.
222	54	One of the skanks: "Did you just say you're really high?
222	55	" My eyes widened.
222	56	I then thought (if she could read minds, it wouldn't matter if I said it or thought it.
222	57	I played it safe.
222	58	) *NOT OUT LOUD*.
222	59	I later found out it was my friend across the hall who had supplied that informative tidbit.
222	60	And that's really all that bears repeating of that night.
223	0	So my church sells food as a way to fundraise money every sunday.
223	1	(Vietnamese church so its spring rolls, vegetable rolls, sticky rice and the sort).
223	2	Well I was asked(more like demanded) to carry a tray of food upstairs, I obliged slightly frustrated because I was in the middle of helping a friend find someone.
223	3	On my way up a lady with some small childeren asked if she could buy some, but she realized she didn't have any money
223	4	so she asked her husband to run to the car and get some.
223	5	Because she had small childeren, and there was already other trays of food heading up I stayed and waited a few minutes.
223	6	While waiting a woman who was "in charge" saw me standing there and started freaking out and telling me to bring the tray upstairs, as if I didn't know where to go, or as if I was stoping to talk to some friends.
223	7	At this point someone else came to me to take the tray, implying I was too useless to do a simple task.
224	0	It was my first day back in my 3rd grade class after being out sick for nearly a week with the stomach flu.
224	1	I started feeling sick during story time after lunch and raised my hand to ask to go to the bathroom, teacher told me to put my hand down, and shushed me when I tried to protest.
224	2	Cue
224	3	this happening 3 more times or so and after the last one I just proceeded to vomit all over the classroom floor, which was carpeted.
225	0	My great uncle was a trucker in and around San Fransisco in the 40's, whose route often took him over the huge hills for which the city is known.
225	1	His truck wasn't all that powerful, so he usually had to stick it into a really low gear and crawl up the hills.
225	2	One day, his little brother, my grandfather, was visiting him and was sitting in the passenger seat, when my great uncle saw a friend coming up behind him.
225	3	His friend had a better truck and was able to climb the hills faster and so was going to be over taking them soon.
225	4	My great uncle had an idea for a prank and had my grandfather take the wheel while he jumped out of the cab.
225	5	When my uncle's friend passed them, my uncle was behind the truck, pushing it up the hill.
226	0	When I was kid, I had a mean step mother and a stupid step sister.
226	1	Whenever I played any games with my step sister I would win and my step mother would accuse me of cheating.
226	2	She'd scream at me and sometimes hit me.
226	3	I finally realized one day that the only way to keep safe was to allow my step sister to win.
226	4	Once when we were playing Monopoly, I gave her some of my money when she was in the bathroom.
226	5	My step mother saw part of what I was doing but to her I was taking money.
226	6	Since she finally had proof that I was a cheater, the beating was extra special that night.
227	0	One Halloween in high school, a friend of mine got indescribably high and pretty hammered and peed her pants in the bathroom.
227	1	We heard laughing and screaming and when we came in, one girl was laughing and pointing at the pants-peer who was to the point of tears.
227	2	When we asked what happened, she could only muster **"My vagina played a mean trick on me"**
227	3	They were apparently trying really hard to make serious faces in the mirror.
227	4	Easily the dumbest reason anyone has ever peed themselves.
228	0	I'm sure this has been posted before, but there are two things that have happened to me that were sort of "reality glitches"
228	1	The first time was when I was laying in my bed in my dorm room and looking out the window at the falling snow at night.
228	2	My room mate was across the room in his bed doing the same thing and we were both talking about how nice it looked when **bam** I blink and suddenly its daytime.
228	3	I look around confused and don't see my room mate anywhere in sight.
228	4	Freaking out and thinking that everyone in the world has disappeared, I go looking for him and eventually find him and I ask him what happened.
228	5	He had absolutely no idea what I was talking about and I asked him where did the night go and he says "We were both looking out the window looking at the snow when you just got really quiet and didn't say anything when I asked you questions so I assumed you were asleep, but when I looked over you were just staring there with your eyes open looking out the window and actually blinked a few times.
228	6	I just thought you were sleeping with your eyes open.
228	7	"
229	0	One summer I was walking my dalmatian (Sweet Pea) and there was this Chihuahua loose
229	1	and it ended up running into my grandmother (who was visiting for the summer).
229	2	Anyways, we spent an entire Saturday afternoon looking for the owners going door to door and someone offered to hand the dog over to a friend who raises Chihuahuas which was good enough for us.
229	3	A few days later I see a poster for the lost dog and rush over to the people we gave the dog to in the process of handing the Chihuahua to their friend.
229	4	A few weeks later I see the Chihuahua running loose but with another dog.
229	5	I couldn't catch them, but I saw her (Chihuahua -we call her Pee Pee) again a month later with a golden retriever and they ended up in our backyard.
229	6	The dogs have tags with their owner's information so we call and the family says they'll be right over.
229	7	This family lives down the street from us and they pick up the dog and give us a bottle of wine as a thank you.
229	8	After a few months we find the Pee Pee, the golden retriever, and this third dog I saw with her the first time one school morning.
229	9	So we call the owners at 7:15 AM to let them know their dogs are loose again and in our property to which the oldest daughter starts crying and begging me to "please why do you steal our dogs?
229	10	Please stop stealing our dogs!
229	11	"
230	0	Similar story, but with a worse ending.
230	1	Before I was born, my dads' cousin got married.
230	2	He and his wife went on their honeymoon, and one night he and his wife were walking by a bar when they spot two guys fighting violently.
230	3	So he got in the middle and broke it up before they got hurt, and both men began to walk away.
230	4	My dads cousin goes to walk away with his wife when one of the men turned around, pulled a knife and stabbed him in the back.
230	5	He passed away that night.
231	0	When I was in school to be a truck driver, I was driving to school and I saw a dog running along the side of the freeway.
231	1	Actually it was an interstate!
231	2	I immediately pulled over and tried to grab him but he ran past me.
231	3	I chased him about 70 yards on the side of the interstate.
231	4	I got close and tried to grab him again, but he got loose and ran into traffic.
231	5	I watched in horror as he dodged cars.
231	6	He started running back and got hit head first by a car.
231	7	This must have messed his brain up as he started running in circles on the road.
231	8	A lady stopped and gave me a box and gloves.
231	9	With the gloves I was able to get him.
231	10	He was bleeding too.
231	11	So I put him in my car and drove him to a vet.
231	12	They said it'd cost $200 dollars to fix him up so I paid for it because I didn't want him to suffer.
231	13	I left him there since I lived in an apartment.
231	14	So I get to school about 2 hours late.
231	15	And we get graded on attendance.
231	16	I explained what happened to the instructor.
231	17	He refused to not count me as tardy.
231	18	I still know I did the right thing.
232	0	This sucks...sorry dude.
232	1	I had something similar happen.
232	2	My first car was a classic 1970s vintage two-door coupe.
232	3	Got it as a teenager and poured my heart and soul into it (used to take it to car shows, etc).
232	4	It was an awesome car for a teenager and I kept it immaculate.
232	5	When I got older, got married and got busy with life, it was parked most of the time and I decided it should make someone else happy.
232	6	I offered to give it to the teenage son of some of my parents friends that were struggling financially and couldn't afford a vehicle for their boy.
232	7	They gladly accepted.
232	8	I found out a month or so later that they sold the car in short order because the teenage son wanted a "fast and furious" type Honda.
232	9	I was heart-broken.
232	10	I guess I shouldn't be upset since it was a gift and his to do with what he wanted, but I was bummed.
232	11	Had I known his plan, I would have rather just given him cash to help him get a Honda and kept my first car.
233	0	So far whoever I told this story to everyone says it's a success story but all I feel is confusion on what the hell just happened.
233	1	I was in a very sketchy relationship with this girl, so I decided to just move on and party a little bit more.
233	2	I go over to my friend's party and I meet a lot of people and get schwasted.
233	3	There was this very pretty girl at the party and I assumed she just got there.
233	4	So I offer her a cigarette and she sips on my vodka.
233	5	After awhile we smoke a little bit and just zone out from the crowd and just have some fun.
233	6	Emergency happened, we ran out of cigarettes so we decided to drive to the local gas station to get some.
233	7	Then we drive to a nearby park and she parks and just tells me how stressed she's been.
233	8	I'm horrible when it comes to anything related to women so I try my best to comfort her and we eventually start intimately kissing and getting naked, we then have some extremely awesome sex and then we cuddle for what seemed like eternity.
233	9	We show up back at the party and her son walks out and says that her husband is going to pick her up soon.
233	10	I basically just freak out in my mind, I felt horrible.
233	11	The husband was 24 and she was around 23 with a 4 year old son.
233	12	Me, an 18 year old high schooler just fucked the shit out of the husband's wife.
233	13	All my friends say that I gave her a night of good happiness and possibly saved their marriage, all I ever thought of was how cruel she was to just so easily ditch him for me just for sex.
234	0	1,0000 comments, this will never get seen, and I've posted it before, but here goes: the epically Superbad-esque story of me losing my virginity.
234	1	Hopefully my ex-girlfriend doesn't Reddit.
234	2	So, this is senior year of high school.
234	3	There's this girl (we'll call her "Kim") who I've been kind of interested in for a while, but she had a boyfriend and I was by no means a player, so I just kind of didn't really follow it up.
234	4	I later found out she had broken up with her bf a couple months ago.
234	5	So, I'm at a party and Kim's there, and I had ended up pinned down, lying down in the rain while a cop car with a searchlight on top scanned the field (long story.
234	6	Basically, cops chased us thinking we were some vandals who had been in the area, when really we were fairly innocent.
234	7	However, we fled like idiots anyway, and got pinned down in a dark field for over 45 minutes while cops searched the area for us).
234	8	Anyway, we eventually escape, and I get back to the house where the party is, and begin to drink.
234	9	A lot, to calm my nerves.
234	10	Bad idea.
234	11	I end up getting really hammered, and Kim and I get to talking about how I was caught in the rain.
234	12	Drunken me slurs something along the lines of, "Whatever, I actually really like the rain, so it's not that big a deal.
234	13	" She claims to love the rain, too, so we decide to go stand in the rain because we're drunk and it seems like a good idea.
234	14	We get outside, only to find that it's STOPPED RAINING.
234	15	Fuck you, God.
234	16	We turn to go back inside, disappointed, and I bust out this drunken gem: "You know what else is like rain, but is warm?...the shower.
234	17	"
234	18	Kim agrees that this is indeed a good idea.
234	19	We get into the shower, and I have no idea how to handle it.
234	20	Leave my clothes on?
234	21	Take off all my clothes but my underwear?
234	22	Take off my underwear?
234	23	We start fully clothed, but lose our outer clothes almost immediately and take off everything but our underwear, and here's the kicker.
234	24	I AM WEARING SUPERMAN BOXERS.
234	25	This is because I was very naive in high school, and moral me wanted to keep my virginity until college (by the way, I was a virgin at the time.
234	26	Very important.
234	27	Remember this).
234	28	Basically, I wore those boxers out whenever I partied (which wasn't too often or anything) as a last-ditch cock-block attempt in case I was too drunk to fend off any girls.
234	29	Of course, never before had I had a girl throw herself at me when I was drunk, but good to be cautious, right?
234	30	You never know what happens at these parties.
234	31	Well, I'm in my boxers in the shower, and Kim's in a bra and panties in the shower (also, she is hot.
234	32	Important point.
234	33	Not drop-dead gorgeous, but she's attractive.
234	34	Also, she has an amazing body).
234	35	She takes off her underwear in the shower, and I get a pretty quick boner, so, what the hell, I take off my boxers, too.
234	36	Now I'm standing there in the shower with a boner with her.
234	37	Normally, I'd be mortified, but I'm still really hammered, so I don't really care.
234	38	Kim starts making out with me.
234	39	We start basically trying to have sex while making out in the shower, but I'm a virgin and have no idea about the mechanics of how to actually initiate sex or anything, and also she's quite a bit shorter, so it's impractical.
234	40	So we get out of the shower, laughing at our pathetic failure, and go to the washing machine in the corner of the bathroom.
234	41	She hops up on it and we start trying to fuck on that.
234	42	It doesn't work, either.
234	43	I'm too inexperienced and too drunk to maintain my balance, although I hide it pretty well.
234	44	We put our underwear on and go upstairs to a bedroom.
234	45	Thank christ we didn't see anyone on the way.
234	46	When we get there, Kim throws me on the bed, pulls off my Superman boxers, and begins to go down on me.
234	47	She then gets on top of me, in nothing but panties, and asks me "If I'm sure I'm okay with this.
234	48	" I actually laughed, I was so drunk.
234	49	Of course I was okay with this.
234	50	Are you kidding me?
234	51	We talk about condoms - I have one in my wallet, but it's in the next room, where the other 15-20 kids are.
234	52	I don't know this girl well, so it would be weird if we went in, grabbed the condom, waved, and left.
234	53	So we just do it sans condom - we've established she's on the pill and neither of us have a disease.
234	54	So we start fucking, changing every five-ten minutes or so from her on top to me bending her over the bed and doing her doggy style.
234	55	Obviously, I was worried about coming too soon, but I was still hammered as shit, so it was actually fine.
234	56	I distinctly remember doing her from behind while she was moaning and drunkenly thinking, "Uh-oh.
234	57	If I don't come soon, Kim's gonna get bored.
234	58	" So, with a Herculean effort, I finish.
234	59	All those years of vehemently protecting my v-card, and after one drunken night it's gone.
234	60	The best part is that we then walked back in to the room, with our still-sopping-wet clothes (from the shower) on, and try to play it off like nothing happened.
234	61	Everyone knew.
234	62	Including the girl in there who I had dated several months earlier.
234	63	Luckily, she was friends with Kim, too, and apparently she had predicted to Kim that Kim would take my virginity on prom night, so her only response was "I told you so.
234	64	" (I ended up dating the girl I slept with that night for the next five months.
235	0	When I was in first grade, my dad packed my lunch.
235	1	He put a ziplock bag of green peppers in there for me to eat raw.
235	2	I loved eating them, but I was embarrassed to pull them out at recess when everybody else was eating fruit rollups and crushed ramen noodles.
235	3	So, when I was alone on the playground, I secretly pulled them out of my lunchpale and stuffed them in my underwear.
235	4	I didn't want the teacher to see that I hadn't finished my lunch.
235	5	All day I was self conscious that she could see the green peppers bulging out of my pants, but I knew I could fool her.
235	6	She came over to me at one point, kneeled down and said in a very reassuring voice 'Andy, did you hide your green peppers down your pants?
235	7	'
235	8	I was horrified.
235	9	I quickly reassured her that I didn't, and she quickly gave up and left me alone.
235	10	For the rest of the day, I tried to think of ways to further prove that I hadn't.
235	11	I needed to redeem myself.
235	12	Then, I came up with a brilliant plan.
235	13	I thought to myself 'If I wear the exact same clothes tomorrow, maybe my pants will look exactly the same, and she will *know for sure* that there hadn't been anything in there the day before'.
235	14	So, the next day I wore the same outfit, and was confident it looked the same.
235	15	I was sure she would notice and understand *that's just how those pants look.
235	16	*
236	0	No one will ever see this but whatever.
236	1	I was getting off my submarine in the Navy after a several month patrol.
236	2	There was one guy who had been acting more and more strange as time went by and one of my chiefs asked me to keep an eye on him because they thought he might be suicidal.
236	3	I asked him to come over and hang out with me and my girlfriend the first night back - we sat around, watching movies, and they both drank because they were 21.
236	4	My girlfriend goes out for a cigarette and some cops show up.
236	5	They thought we were drinking underage - I tell them they were drinking at my place and they grab me for minor in possession.
236	6	While he and I sat in the drunk tank, he confessed that he was suicidal.
236	7	I eventually got him some help.
236	8	Meanwhile, I get courtmartialed and spent my 21st birthday confined to the submarine.
237	0	My brother and I are very close, but I didn't know his wife very well before the wedding.
237	1	I was happy to be asked to be a bridesmaid and wore the dress she wanted in the color she wanted with the jewelry she wanted.
237	2	I understood when she gave me guidelines about what style and color of shoes to purchase.
237	3	I happily texted her a picture of the shoes I found for approval before I bought them.
237	4	I fly in the day before the wedding day and I need to get my hair cut.
237	5	My mom is having her hair done by her stylist the morning of the wedding, so she offers to have mine done at the same time.
237	6	The bride is having one of her good friends do the makeup and hair for the brides at the wedding site, so we are sure to clear this her.
237	7	She lets us know that we HAVE to be at the location by a certain time to have our makeup done--perfectly understandable.
237	8	The only problem is that my mother is chronically late for everything.
237	9	We get our hair done and show up at the location 15 minutes late.
237	10	I run in first thing and slip my dress and shoes on and so all I need done is my makeup
237	11	and I'm good to go.
237	12	I hear the bride yelling at my mother because she is late and is going to hold up everything, so I rush in to make my apologies.
237	13	When I get in, the bride is sitting on this throne (only way to describe it) getting her hair done, yelling at my mother.
237	14	But all of the other bridesmaids are still in their regular clothes and no one has their hair or makeup done yet!
237	15	So, while my mom and I were technically late, we were also the farthest along in being ready and weren't going to hold up anything.
237	16	To make matters worse, the bride has never seen me in my dress, but she looks at me when I walk in and says "Well, look at you *Barbie*, you're late so you're going to have to get your makeup done *last*" in a very rude tone.
237	17	Now, my name is not Barbie, but I am tall, thin and blonde.
237	18	I had my dress altered to fit me better, so it looked quite nice on me and thought she would be pleased.
237	19	I end up sitting quietly in the corner by myself while the bride and other bridesmaids give me dirty looks and wait for an hour and a half to have my makeup done thinking about how I just got called a derisive nickname for looking nice in the outfit she picked for me on her wedding day.
237	20	I thought the worst was over when the wedding started, but then it started raining and the outdoor wedding got moved inside.
237	21	We hadn't rehearsed inside, so when I walked up the isle to the dais, I didn't move over far enough to leave room for the other 4 bridesmaids.
237	22	I had to be told to shuffle down by the next bridesmaid and not only was I completely embarrassed, but the spot I had to stand had a very cold floor vent blowing up my skirt for the entire ceremony.
237	23	Boy, did I hear about my screw-up for the rest of the reception.
237	24	I will be thankful if I'm never asked to be in another wedding.
238	0	A couple of weeks ago I legitimately tried some trees, and I *hated* it.
238	1	I felt out of control, and it took me to a very, very dark place that no amount of awesome TV shows or music could pull me out of, and I couldn't even sleep it off because I was so panicked.
238	2	I feel sad now, because I thought it'd be awesome for my creativity and that I'd be so happy and enlightened and fulfilled, but no.
238	3	:( More power to those of you that love it and feel awesome, though; doesn't change my opinion that it should be legalized.
239	0	I was out for my brother's bachelor party on St. Patrick's day, as we were at a popular bar in a popular bar district, and it was later in the day, so it was mostly the aftermath of St. Pat's.
239	1	The bathrooms were down stairs at the end of a short hallway.
239	2	This hallway looked like a fucking war zone.
239	3	The floor was literally covered in broken beer bottles.
239	4	I don't know what happened down there.
239	5	Anyways, I take a leak, and on the way out notice a chick kind of huddled in a corner.
239	6	I was relatively coherent still, so I asked her if she was OK and if she needed help up the stairs.
239	7	She was completely disoriented and really didn't know what was going on, who she was with, etc..
239	8	I used to work security at an all-girls dorm and I had seen girls come in that had been roofied, and that's what it looked like to me.
239	9	So I helped her up the stairs and said something to a group of waitress and bar tenders, and they literally just laughed in my face.
239	10	It was appalling to me that they could not give the smallest shit what happened to this person.
239	11	After accosting them a bit, they said there were some cops outside.
239	12	So, I go out to the cops and hoped they would help, and they were less resistant, but gave me the third degree about it, asking me if I was the one who drugged her, asking the girl if I had hurt her, all this crazy shit.
239	13	Finally they handed her off to someone else (there were cops everywhere), and let me go on my way.
240	0	My father is a trucker, and I have a few stories of when I accompanied him.
240	1	Probably the best would be the time we were solicited by a lot lizard in Colorado.
240	2	It was night, and we were parked at a truck stop and about to go to sleep.
240	3	I was 15 at the time, and had to go to the bathroom
240	4	so I told my dad
240	5	and he said "you know where the bathrooms are"
240	6	I open the door to go to the truck stop facilities and there is a woman looking up at me.
240	7	She asks if I was the guy she was talking to on the radio.
240	8	I say no.
240	9	She then smiles and asks if I want some company.
240	10	Decision time.
240	11	It had never crossed my mind that she was a prostitute, I thought she was just homeless and wanted a warm place to spend the night.
240	12	I say, sure you look like you could use some friendly company.
240	13	Luckily, my dad notices this exchange and shoos her, as one would a stray dog, before she even began climbing into the cab.
240	14	He still makes fun of me for almost inviting in a prostitute.
241	0	When I was a kid I had a bed wetting problem.
241	1	I am not ashamed of this now, as thousands of other kids have had the same problems... at the time however, this was humiliating.
241	2	My younger brother started telling other kids around school how extensive the issue was.
241	3	I was mortified.
241	4	Even after our mother told him to knock it off, he continued.
241	5	So I decided to level the playing field.
241	6	The whole "hand in cup of warm water" deal didn't work.
241	7	I stood over him as he slept one night and pissed on him.
241	8	The next morning, my mom was horrified and wound up taking a call from my grandmother.
241	9	"I don't know what to do, now BOTH of them are pissing the bed," she explained, clearly frustrated.
241	10	After a few more times of "framing" my brother as a bed wetter he completely stopped using my embarrassing problem as entertainment.
242	0	It wasn't a throwaway, I just never told anyone my username.
242	1	I didn't have any pictures of my face, but I had stories that were things that I experienced (nothing bad, but stuff that I'd prefer not to have my face attached to.
242	2	)
242	3	I posted in the subreddit for makeup exchanges and I offered $25 worth of brand new product to anyone.
242	4	It was super cool and the girl who I offered it to was super sweet (and actually sent me some tea and a lipstick in return).
242	5	Well, before I'd sent it to her some random person on a throwaway messaged me my full name and a link to my facebook account.
242	6	I'd never shared my account name with anyone, and my posts had no personal information.
242	7	It creeped me the heck out, I deleted the account, made a new one with a username similar to the old one, messaged the girl I was sending stuff to, sent her the shipping details and explained why I had a new account and deleted that one.
242	8	I've since made a new account, and I don't care who finds this one.
242	9	I have nothing to hide, and I've even told my mom and sister my username when they asked.
242	10	I post pictures of my face all the time so someone who I know is bound to find out who I am.
242	11	I don't care, all I post about are make up and period jokes.
243	0	I slept-walked one day and was having a vivid dream.
243	1	Because I was in a dream, I thought I was in the living room, but I had to pee extremely bad.
243	2	I kept walking from one exit to the other exit of the room trying to get out, but because I was really in my bedroom and the door was located in a completely different place in my room, I could never find the knob to find the door.
243	3	I ended up crying and pissing on myself.
243	4	It was one of my most shameful experiences.
244	0	Not me, but my father told me last week about a couple years ago when he was driving a road train here in Queensland, Australia.
244	1	It was him and three other road trains I think, and he was second in line.
244	2	Some guy tried to overtake all of them before the overtaking lane ended.
244	3	This lane isn't very long (about 1km) and they are few and far between along this road.
244	4	Now this guy had run out of room by the time he had gotten to the truck at the front, and so he went off the road and rolled his car.
244	5	The trucks all stopped and my father got out and ran towards the car, which was now on fire.
244	6	The first truck driver was much closer to the car than my father was, due to these trucks being a good hundred metres long.
244	7	When Dad got there the truck driver just had his hands in the air as if to say, "Fuck this, nope, I can't handle this.
244	8	" What he had seen was the man, still conscious, flailing about in the car, burning alive.
244	9	Dad didn't want to see something so horrid that so he didn't look, but he was still haunted by the fact a man was alive one minute ago, driving past him, but was now in the burning car he saw ahead.
244	10	The truck driver is still basically a basket case today, from what I've heard.
244	11	He still can't get over it, and feels terrible, but it's definitely not his fault.
244	12	Driving back from the road trip someone tried overtaking my father again on that same stretch of road, not 2kms away from the night before.
244	13	There were police up ahead and the guy was up to about 200km just to get ahead of dad before the lane ended.
244	14	So he slams on the breaks just before he can get seen by the coppers, and Dad says he barely braked in time to not send him flying ahead, due to road trains having a much harder time braking than a car does.
244	15	They get pulled over and my Dad abused the fuck out of this guy because he was still upset about the night before and he sure as hell didn't want to see that shit again, and the guy acted like he had no idea what he did.
244	16	I have never seen my Dad afraid, but I could see in his eyes how scared he was when he told me this, because that moment terrified him so much that he could have been the guy who had taken another man's life so quickly.
244	17	I hope that people can understand that trucks, especially road trains, don't have the same capabilities as cars, and you should know how to act around them, and know how they work.
245	0	When I was about nine years old, I was spending a week at horse camp with a group of other girls, all older (pre-teens/early teens) than one except for one who was about six.
245	1	We'd all ridden at that barn for a while and knew the place, horses, and rules.
245	2	Our trainer had to make an emergency feed run and told us to stay out of the stalls and pens until she got back.
245	3	The shop was right down the road, it wouldn't even be more than ten minutes.
245	4	I picked up a bucket and went out to the arena to collect tiny shells while she was gone because I was no good at staying still, and none of the girls were friendly.
245	5	I started back early, and noticed a blood trail heading from the biggest pen toward the tables.
245	6	The youngest girl was laying on one with her head split open and the other girls looking at her.
245	7	I asked what happened and it turns out they'd played tag blindfolded in the pen with the biggest, wildest horses.
245	8	The girl had mistaken a horse's tail for a girl's hair and smacked him, so he kicked her.
245	9	I went to call our trainer on the barn phone but the girls got really mad and scared me away from the phone.
245	10	So I ran down the road until I saw the trainer's truck and told her what happened.
245	11	The girl went to the hospital, where she eventually healed but became mentally slow with an ugly scar, and died later on.
245	12	I eventually had to leave that barn because the girls would hurry to leave only the scariest horses left for me to ride in lessons, untie my horses when I was getting a brush or something
245	13	so I'd be in trouble for a loose horse, make fun of me in general, and let me "help" them by cooling down a horse, only to leave me standing alone when it turned out that horse shouldn't have been under saddle for whatever reason.
245	14	I became pretty timid and untrusting after that.
246	0	Perfect.
246	1	So my buddy and i went to a themed party awhile back.
246	2	He had been seeing this asian girl for a while, who was also attending.
246	3	They were dancing and grinding for most of it, but then I see her sitting in a kissing booth ($1 a kiss).
246	4	I promptly hand her $20, in my most bro move yet, and tell her to wait there.
246	5	I run to grab my friend only to see him dancing with another asian girl.
246	6	I tell him I just paid $20 so he could make out with his girl, only to have him ask "Who am I dancing with?
246	7	"
247	0	When I was little, around 8, I hated going to the dentist, he always made me uncomfortable for some reason.
247	1	I remember thinking his smile stretched too far and seemed forced, like clowns.
247	2	Anyway, my mom always came with me, and went back so I wouldn't be scared.
247	3	One day, my dad had me (divorced parents), and had to take me to the dentist, but tried to make me go back alone so he could sit out in the lobby doing whatever.
247	4	The assistants had to literally drag me back to the room and you could hear me screaming and crying down the hall, refusing to sit in the chair.
247	5	Finally, my dad came back to get me, irritated I'd made a scene, he rescheduled my appointment to when my mom would have me, and we just left, he made a big deal about how bad I was acting and told my mom she was spoiling me and all sorts of shit.
247	6	Two weeks later, it's on the news that my dentist was charged with child pornography, after molesting children under anesthesia and photographing it.
248	0	In second grade i had this pokeball, like a little spring loaded one that was supposed to have a plastic pokemon inside, of course i lost that.
248	1	But anyways, one day i caught a wasp inside the ball as was super proud of myself, so i did what any second grader would do.
248	2	I took the thing to show and tell.
248	3	In front of my entire class i yelled "Go Beedrill!
248	4	" and let the wasp out.
248	5	it stung my best friend three times.
248	6	he wouldn't talk to me for a week.
249	0	A few years ago a bunch of my friends had decided to go out to an old, abandoned schoolhouse one night (must have been around 11:30 or 12:00).
249	1	I hadn't seen it before, so I decided to catch a ride out with one of them.
249	2	It was about a 30 minute drive on a gravel to get to said schoolhouse
249	3	and we were the first car to head out there.
249	4	I noticed a bit of an orange in the sky, but I just thought it was street lights or an odd reflection from the moon or something.
249	5	There was a girl in the car with us, so my friend decides to tell a fake ghost story to try and scare her a bit.
249	6	He tells the story "The original building burned down a long time ago, and one girl died in the building during the fire.
249	7	They decided to rebuild the schoolhouse in the same spot but it was haunted by this girl, so they had to abandon the building".
249	8	The second he finishes telling the story, we turn the corner where the building is.
249	9	The building is on fire.
249	10	Two story building with a huge attic, completely engulfed in flames that are easily 30 ft high.
249	11	So we all start freaking out, which seems appropriate, and try to figure out what we should do.
249	12	Do we just leave?
249	13	Do we wake the people in the nearby houses ?
249	14	Do we call the cops?
249	15	Do we try to control the fire?
249	16	Because the cellphone reception out there was so bad we texted someone in town "Call the fire department, this fucking thing is burning".
249	17	At first they didn't believe us, but then we convinced them that it was.
249	18	About 10 minutes later they get back to us saying that the fire department doesn't have jurisdiction in the area (there were no fire hydrants around).
249	19	So my friend and I start talking.
249	20	We clue in that the surrounding forest is dry as a bone, since it hasn't rained a drop in at least two weeks.
249	21	If the fire spreads, there is gonna be a huge forest fire and it will destroy all of the houses nearby.
249	22	The decision is made to try and minimize the damage that this is going to do.
249	23	We grab a long log nearby and try to push the structure in on itself as it is burning, so it will just burn out.
249	24	We are at this for about an hour, getting blisters and burns from how hot this fire is.
249	25	A bunch more friends end up there as we are almost done pushing the structure back in.
249	26	At this point I'm feeling like a superhero or something, because I have just the forest.
249	27	Then the cop shows up.
249	28	He starts playing the blame game, trying to get us to admit we did it (which we definitely didn't).
249	29	We explain to him what happened, he seems skeptical (even though we were the ones that called it in and stuck around to try and prevent a fire).
249	30	Then this guy starts to look at all the vehicles, and starts going "you have a busted light, you drove too many people, etc.
249	31	" So he makes us drive back 2 people at a time even though it is a half hour drive back into town, and he refuses to take anyone back with him.
249	32	By the time i get back to my house it is about 6 or 7 in the morning.
249	33	The next day I call my mom (who is on a vacation to Vegas) what had happened, and that the cop thinks I did it.
249	34	About a week later I get a call from the cops asking me to come down and give them a statement about what happened.
249	35	My mom and step dad are back in town at this point, and they come with me.
249	36	I write down what had happened, give the paper back to the cop and go on my way.
249	37	A few days later, another call from the police.
249	38	"We need you to come down for questioning.
249	39	" So I go down, parents with me again.
249	40	The cop starts telling my mom and step dad what had happened, and they tell him that there is no need to tell them, I had informed them as soon as I could have.
249	41	The cop is surprised because I apparently don't seem to be the young hooligan that he thought I was.
249	42	So then he goes to his plan B and starts talking about how irresponsible kids can be when they are with their friends; the whole peer pressure talk.
249	43	My step dad interrupts him and says "I know how kids act, I have been a school administrator for 20 years.
249	44	" Well now the cop shuts up and asks if there is anything else I know.
249	45	Which there isn't at this point.
249	46	He asks if I find out anything else to let him know.
249	47	After a few days of me telling this story every 10 minutes, a friend walks up to me.
249	48	She says that she was on this guys Facebook account and saw in a chat window that he had said "I can't believe those dumb kids stayed around the fire and they are getting blamed for what we did" or something like that.
249	49	So now I know who did it, and I call the police station and tell them i know something else.
249	50	I tell them this, he takes in the information and tells me "
249	51	yeah we are curious because this building is owned by the salvation army and was going to be redone and put into the museum.
249	52	" I don't think much of it at this point.
249	53	Well it turns out that the guy that burned the building down, his parents run the salvation army in town here.
249	54	I kinda laughed because it might have been an attempt at an insurance fraud or something (but I doubt that thing would have been worth much).
249	55	I don't think anyone was proven to have done this in the end.
249	56	I learned a valuable lesson though: if the cops are involved, don't try to be a hero.
250	0	Something like this happened to me a few years ago.
250	1	I backed into a girl's car and left a smallish dent, noticeable because of the paint.
250	2	I felt awful and left a note, even though she was parking in a no-parking zone, because I should've been looking more closely.
250	3	She calls me and says she's going to get an estimate.
250	4	She gets three, and they're all about $1000, which is insane to me since it was a dent on her door.
250	5	I ask her to send me the estimates.
250	6	At first she refuses but I tell her I'm not paying a dime unless she does so.
250	7	I get them, and there is SO MUCH bullshit on there that I did NOT do, such as a dent on her bumper, the door on the other side of the car being messed up, and even her mirrors being chipped.
250	8	I was livid.
250	9	I asked her to get an actual estimate with just the dent and she tried to make up some bullshit about how they needed to remove her back bumper to fix her front passenger door.
250	10	I told her how I didn't appreciate being lied to and how she tried to scam me, so I just ignored all calls from that point on.
250	11	Sorry that it almost happened to you, glad that husband was there to set her straight!
251	0	Sadly, my boyfriend tells our first date story in this category.
251	1	I have a lot of social anxiety issues, especially around touching, mostly due to lack thereof.
251	2	We'd both expressed interest in each other but I wasn't sure it was worth the emotional effort, but then we were the only ones of our friends who showed up to a rock concert.
251	3	Later I walked him home thinking, y'know, this is nice, I'm kind of into this, and then he tries to kiss me and I literally just panic and go stiff as a board and say "eep.
251	4	"
251	5	He backs off and is like "okay...
251	6	nevermind?
251	7	" and I just blurt out "Maybe try this again when I am drunker?
251	8	" Face palms all round.
251	9	But hey it's been two and a half years and going strong, so you never know.
252	0	haha I did the exact same thing except my sister was in a different room
252	1	and I was about 9 and my sister 7.
252	2	One night I was sleepily walking to and I mistakenly took the wrong door and the first right in the hallway not the second which is the bathroom.
252	3	Well the first right was my sisters room
252	4	so i went on my marry way and started to piss all over my sisters feet thinking it was the toilet, and mid stream my mom bursts in because she herd some ruckus.
252	5	She starts screaming waking my sister and making me realize where i was and what i was doing to my sister.
252	6	My sister freaks out and i am still pissing everywhere because i am like mid stream and couldn't stop.
252	7	A lot of yelling ensued and so on and so forth.
252	8	Well to this day my sister wont let me forget that i did this to her.
253	0	My ex-boss kept hounded me for two weeks if I could find him an ounce of some weed.
253	1	One day he said that he had back problems and he really needed something.
253	2	I felt sorry for him so I was able to find him an ounce of some bud &amp; sold it to him.
253	3	Three day's short of a year later I was arrested and charged with a felony.
253	4	I don't sell weed.
253	5	I'm not a dealer.
253	6	I was able to pin point the only time I've ever sold anything to anyone.
253	7	Now i'm stuck with a Class D Felony for Distribution of Marijuana...
253	8	fucking sucks man..
254	0	One time my daughter's hamster got loose and went under the stove.
254	1	For about a week we tried to get it out, but it would just hide under there where we couldn't reach.
254	2	Finally my husband tied a string around a piece of carrot and pushed it under the stove.
254	3	I was standing there making fun of him, but he dragged that carrot out and the hamster came out after it.
254	4	Genius.
255	0	So I got down to doing some old research, since I never really looked into it.
255	1	I always assumed it was a green mamba, because it was, well, green.
255	2	A quick google revealed that black mambas can also be green, and that baby green mambas (such as the one I owned) are in fact YELLOW.
255	3	But based on the images I dug up, my little Salazar (he was more olive green, but not super dark) may very well have been a young black mamba.
255	4	Holy fuck.
255	5	Not to mention, he was fast as fuck and tended to stay on the ground in his terrarium, rather than in the branches as green mambas do.
255	6	Holy fuck.
256	0	I lived in a small college town and my apartment complex was walking distance from the bar/downtown area.
256	1	One weekday night, I stepped out on our front porch to smoke a cigarette or two (I was up late studying).
256	2	I brought my text book with me and say down on the stairs while I smoked.
256	3	A girl, who I had never met but who lived one apartment over but down on the ground floor, came home from downtown.
256	4	She was by herself and you could tell from her walk she had been drinking.
256	5	She got in her apartment and barely got the door closed before some guy, who came out of nowhere, knocked on her door.
256	6	She opened and I noticed he introduced himself, which was weird because it was after 2:30 am, who comes to a strange girl's apartment at that time?
256	7	So I decide to stay outside and pay attention.
256	8	They ended up talking for over ten minutes, she later acknowledged how weird the situation was but did not know how to end the conversation.
256	9	He would do the creepiest things, like he reached up and strokes her hair at least three times, and would try and slowly inch his way closer to her and the door.
256	10	I made a point of being loud with my textbook so he would know I was there and he disappeared as eerily as he had come.
256	11	We called the cops, and days later they had the girl and me sit with a sketch artist.
256	12	As soon as the sketch was made public, floods of calls came in.
256	13	Guy turned out to be a serial rapist who followed lone girls home from bars and pretended to be a cab offering them a ride.
256	14	This girl just got lucky because she lived so close to the bars, he didn't get a chance to pull the cab routine.
256	15	TL/DR: creepy creeperson followed a neighbor home, probably only left because there was a witness, serial rapist apprehended.
257	0	I was in Minot, ND with my old band.
257	1	Our tour van blew a head gasket and we were stuck there for a few days.
257	2	Everyone was tired on day 2, but I was wide awake.
257	3	I walk for a bit and make it to some scummy bar.
257	4	I'm obviously not from around there, and nobody is saying a word to me.
257	5	After 2 beers, I start to get a tad nauseous and dizzy.
257	6	I put my head in my hand and try to let it pass, but it keeps getting worse.
257	7	Suddenly, a voice says "you'll feel pain tonight".
257	8	I jump and look up and a tall roughly 40 year old man is walking to the bathroom, turns back and glances at me.
257	9	I called my friends and got the fuck out of there.
257	10	I slept for 12-13 hours and felt awful/loopy the next day.
257	11	I was roofied.
258	0	One time in high school my friends and I had a dance party in someones basement.
258	1	We were all upper middle class suburbanite "good kids" and it was extremely under control, no alcohol or anything.
258	2	We had blacklights and loud music and funny clothes and glow sticks and it was a good time.
258	3	I bought some smarties early in the day and put them in a plastic bag.
258	4	While we were all cavorting around, I started handing them to people pretending they were ecstasy.
258	5	It was fun, there were a few laughs, and overall the party was really really fun.
258	6	The next morning, as my friends mom was cleaning the basement, she found the baggie and freaked out.
258	7	She bitched out my friend and grounded her *even after my friend explained it was candy*.
258	8	She was upset that my friend hung out with people who would even joke about that.
258	9	I had an extremely tame high school experience and this story seems to exemplify that.
259	0	When I was 15-16 I would often sneak into my friends parents rooms when I was over at their house, and snoop through their moms underwear drawers.
259	1	I was pretty close friends with their families, so this was a real rush to me when I would do it - that I was going to get busted.
259	2	I would never take anything valuable, just a pair of panties or a bra, either out of their laundry bins or from their dressers.
259	3	This one time, My friend had to run out to the store to pick up a pizza we had ordered, and left me alone in the house while I played video games.
259	4	As soon as he left, I bolted upstairs and dove into his hot MILF moms laundry pile, and started jerking off with her panties and bras wrapped around my dick.
259	5	I looked around some more, and found a buttload of dildos and sex toys in her stoage trunk; I had hit the jack-off pot!
259	6	Something came over me: All I coud think about was "THESE WERE IN HER PUSSY!!!".
259	7	I tucked two of them into the waistband of my pants, bolted up the street to my house, where I proceeded to fuck my ass and suck on them as I sniffed her panties.
259	8	I was never caught, but I heard her mentioning to her son a few weeks later about some "personal stuff" that went "missing" from her room.
259	9	She obviously knew it was one of his friends, but she never approached me about it, and I wasn't about to give them back.
259	10	Come to think of it...
259	11	damn that was fun.

260	10	Does anyone remember this kid's show?
260	11	It was called Candle Cove and I must have been 6 or 7, I never found reference to it anywhere
260	12	so I think it was on a local station around 1971 or 1972.
260	13	I lived in Ironton at the time.
260	14	I don't remember which station, but I do remember it was on at a weird time, like 4:00 PM.

260	24	YES!
260	25	Okay I'm not crazy!
260	26	I remember Pirate Percy.
260	27	I was always kind of scared of him.
260	28	He looked like he was built from parts of other dolls, real low-budget.
260	29	His head was an old porcelain baby doll, looked like an antique that didn't belong on the body.
260	30	I don't remember what station this was!
260	31	I don't think it was WTSF though.

260	35	Sorry to ressurect this old thread but I know exactly what show you mean, Skyshale.
260	36	I think Candle Cove ran for only a couple months in '71, not '72.
260	37	I was 12 and I watched it a few times with my brother.
260	38	It was channel 58, whatever station that was.
260	39	My mom would let me switch to it after the news- Let me see what I remember.
260	40	It took place in Candle cove, and it was about a little girl who imagined herself to be friends with pirates.
260	41	The pirate ship was called the Laughingstock, and Pirate Percy wasn't a very good pirate because he got scared too easily.
260	42	And there was calliope music constantly playing.
260	43	Don't remember the girl's name.
260	44	Janice or Jade or something.
260	45	Think it was Janice.

260	49	Thank you Jaren!!!
260	50	Memories flooded back when you mentioned the Laughingstock and channel 58.
260	51	I remember the bow of the ship was a wooden smiling face, with the lower jaw submerged.
260	52	It looked like it was swallowing the sea and it had that awful Ed Wynn voice and laugh.
260	53	I especially remember how jarring it was when they switched from the wooden/plastic model, to the foam puppet version of the head that talked.

260	62	Ugh mike, I got a chill reading that.
260	63	Yes I remember.
260	64	That's what the ship always told Percy when there was a spooky place he had to go in, like a cave or a dark room where the treasure was.
260	65	And the camera would push in on Laughingstock's face with each pause.
260	66	YOU HAVE... TO GO...
260	67	INSIDE.
260	68	With his two eyes askew and that flopping foam jaw and the fishing line that opened and closed it.
260	69	Ugh.
260	70	It just looked so cheap and awful.
260	71	You guys remember the villain?
260	72	He had a face that was just a handlebar mustache above really tall, narrow teeth.

260	82	That wasn't the villain, the puppet with the mustache.
260	83	That was the villain's sidekick, Horace Horrible.
260	84	He had a monocle too, but it was on top of the mustache.
260	85	I used to think that meant he had only one eye.
260	86	But yeah, the villain was another marionette.
260	87	The Skin-Taker.

260	94	i seriously could not look at the screen when the skin taker showed up.
260	95	he just descended out of nowhere on his strings, just a dirty skeleton wearing that brown top hat and cape.
260	96	and his glass eyes that were too big for his skull.

260	115	The girl was just moaning and crying like she had been through hours of this-

260	148	she said she was suprised i could remember that and i asked why, and she said "because i used to think it was so strange that you said 'i'm gona go watch candle cove now mom' and then you would tune the tv to static and juts watch dead air for 30 minutes.

261	0	When I was 12 or 13 we went to a McDonalds on the way to the beach...
261	1	I went to pee before I ate and to wash my hands...just as I started peeing this guy comes in, walks to the urinal next to me and just watches.
261	2	Doesn't pee.
261	3	Just watches.
261	4	I can see him out of the corner of my eye, his eyes locked onto my junk (what there was of it).
261	5	I had a bathing suit on so I'm doing the whole junk flop over thing (guys know what that means) so I can't hide it.
261	6	I can't stop it (I can now though...not sure why when you're a kid you can't stop your pee).
261	7	He just smiled creepily as I finished, put things away and washed my hands.
261	8	He just stood there smiling.
261	9	I gave him one more look as I left the bathroom and never saw him again.
261	10	I was with my friend's mom and I didn't say anything because I didn't want to get in trouble and really wanted to go to the beach.
261	11	That logic makes no sense, I realize that now, but I ate my Filet O Fish with a WTF?
261	12	look on my face and had an awesome day at the beach.
262	0	At the age of 14ish me and a friend were outside a jewelry store.
262	1	We looked at a showcase, and just for fun I tried lifting the glass up, which turned out to be unlocked.
262	2	We look at each other, and decide to tell them.
262	3	We enter the big scary jewelry store, and tell the manager they forgot to lock it.
262	4	She goes out, locks it, and looks at us with the meanest face, and asks: "Did you steal anything?".
262	5	We just say no and leave, quite shocked at that response.
263	0	When I was a young boy I went to the roller skating rink.
263	1	I was eleven and having a really good time.
263	2	I noticed that there were a small group of four kids skating with their mom.
263	3	She was in front of them when one of them fell over, so I skated over and helped him up by lifting him by his underarms.
263	4	She turned around and saw him struggling to stand and started yelling at me for knocking over her 5 year old.
263	5	I started crying because this 40 year old was yelling at me for helping.
263	6	It was then one of my teachers came over and took me away from the lady, then I got in more trouble even when I tried to explain myself.
264	0	My friend showed me this drinking game called Tourette's.
264	1	It involves a normal deck of cards and two players.
264	2	The top card is flipped, and whatever first letter the card name starts with, you have to shout out a random word that starts with the same letter.
264	3	For example, a three shows up.
264	4	If you don't yell "TIGERS" first, you lose and you drink.
264	5	I flipped a nine and loudly and quickly yelled NIGGER with the biggest smile on my face because I won!
264	6	This was in the middle of a party.
265	0	A little backstory- I'm from TX.
265	1	The chupacabra legend is pretty big here and in Mexico.
265	2	I'm a big fan of cryptids so I always liked to think of chupacabra as a creature whose territory covered huge portions of both Mexico and TX.
265	3	(I put way too much thought into imaginary creatures)
265	4	I was working on the school newspaper and we did a halloween back page with different scary legendary creatures with a silly quip to go with each of them like "The fearsome were-coyote steals chickens every full moon!".
265	5	I, completely not thinking, suggested for chupacabra "Chupacabra opposes immigration reform.
265	6	"
265	7	In my head it made perfect sense because building a wall on the border would essentially cut his home in half.
265	8	I wasn't even thinking about real people (which was pretty thoughtless and ethnocentric anyway, I admit.
265	9	)
265	10	But I felt terrible because some of my Latino classmates were offended.
265	11	I wish I could have had a chance to explain that I didn't mean for it to sound that way, that I just forget that nobody else knows about the mythology I make up in my head.
266	0	My husband and I took a canoe out on a large lake that was flat as glass.
266	1	We capsized in the middle of said lake when a freak storm popped up instantly out of nowhere.
266	2	I had to swim for help.
266	3	I dragged myself onto a lady's dock and she ran out to me.
266	4	All I could say was "My husband is still out there.
266	5	" By that time the storm was gone so we got into her boat and went to look.
266	6	I could see the canoe but not him.
266	7	Horrifying.
266	8	But we circled around and he was holding onto it on the other side.
266	9	He didn't have a life jacket and I did, so that's why I was confident enough to let go and swim for assistance.
266	10	If he would've let go of the canoe he would have drowned.
266	11	The waves were huge and he's just an average-skilled swimmer.
267	0	Not me but a coworker.
267	1	He bought a copy of Microsoft Office 2007 from Tigerdirect, but when he got the box, there were two boxed copies of Microsoft Office.
267	2	He called them up and told the customer service rep that he had received two copies, and only paid for one, so he wanted a shipping label to send the second one back.
267	3	They didn't believe him since the packing slip said one copy.
267	4	He eventually got a manager on the phone and they accused him of stealing the second copy and they were going to charge him full retail unless he paid to send it back, or at some point they were going to charge him and wouldn't refund him until they received it (again, with him paying shipping).
267	5	After a few days of phone calls back and forth and hours of wasted time, he ended up getting a label to ship the thing back to them.
267	6	As a result, he's probably never buying anything from TigerDirect ever again, or he said that if he does and that happens again, he's just keeping the thing, because they didin't even known about it until he told them.
267	7	Sad really, that someone wants to return over $100 in merchandise received for free, and has to fight to get a return label.
267	8	Anyways, he orders from Newegg now, like the rest of us that prefer decent customer service.
268	0	One time I met a girl online, and for our first date we went bowling after a cheap dinner.
268	1	Well, as we're bowling, my dinner began to not sit well with me, and I had to run to the bathroom.
268	2	Before I can get my sexy first date jeans off, I proceed to poop myself a little bit.
268	3	I was able to make a save for most of it, but I certainly pooped on my pants and leg.
268	4	I was able to make a hasty cleanup operation in that bowling alley bathroom - enough so that I could proceed with the date without too much suspicion.
268	5	I didn't tell her this until more than a year after this date.
268	6	Three months ago, we got married.
268	7	I wish I could say this was the only time that I've pooped myself in her presence throughout our courtship.
269	0	This situation made me lose one of my good friends.
269	1	My friend is getting married in October.
269	2	We were friends for about 8 years.
269	3	She asked me to be one of her bridesmaids and I happily obliged.
269	4	Little did I know she was going to be big-headed ego bridezilla.
269	5	She demanded that everyone wear these hideous dresses that we had to pay for.
269	6	I was okay with it since they didn't cost that much.
269	7	She also demanded that all the girls dye their hair because she could be the ONLY blonde one there.
269	8	I have naturally blonde hair and I'm not going to dye it for a day.
269	9	She got pissed at me that I wouldn't dye my hair and replaced me with a girl that shes known for years but recently become friends with.
269	10	They used to talk crap behind each others backs.
269	11	Next she had to nerve to ask everyone who wasn't in her bridal party to pay 80$ per guest (160$ for me and my boyfriend) for food.
269	12	Shes having a buffet of BBQ.
269	13	She also expected a present that was valued above 50$.
269	14	She sent all of this via Facebook.
269	15	I sent her a message back and told her I would either pay for the food or a present and for her to choose.
269	16	I got a hard copy invite recently and realized that the date was the same date my boyfriend is doing Tough Mudder competition.
269	17	I chose that over her wedding.
270	0	The night of my brother's wedding, me and my girlfriend went back to our hotel.
270	1	Down the hall, there was an after party for a different wedding, with people in tuxes and bridesmaids dresses drinking and partying in their room.
270	2	As we walked by, the bride storms out screaming into a cell phone, telling someone to get back there right now.
270	3	As she hung up, she screamed into the room with the party "Who the fuck abandons their bride on their wedding night?!
270	4	" Apparently the groom was at a bar down the street with some friends.
270	5	Not sure if she constitues a bridezilla, since she made a good point.
270	6	Who the fuck leaves their bride on their wedding night?
271	0	I had to smuggle a rat from L.A. to NC.
271	1	They wouldn't allow her to be on board or underneath, despite saying it was no problem days before.
271	2	As this was back in early 2001, I was fortunate that September hadn't come yet, but was still in a pickle since I really liked this rat and was moving across the country, never to return.
271	3	SO, my then-gf and I got the airlines to change our tickets for the next day and stayed the night at a hotel, where we planned for our big smuggling adventure.
271	4	The next morning, I made sure all metal was off my body (including all piercings, just to be safe), and put on a hoodie that had a pocket on the belly, one of those open-ended things that you can put your hands in when its cold.
271	5	I sewed up one end and part of another, put the rat in, and sealed it with a safety pin holding closed the last little bit.
271	6	I cut off that hoodie's hood, and put another hoodie on over this.
271	7	Checked the mirror, and if I sucked in my gut a bit, one could hardly see the bulge of rat amidst all the other fabric.
271	8	Then, I put some clothes in the animal carrier that she was going to be transported in (and that the airlines had told me was ok, just a little cat carrier thing for small animals), and we went to the airport.
271	9	We checked our luggage, and then I started the PLAN.
271	10	I was already sweaty from wearing the two hoodies in LA, so I had my desired appearance down; from then, it was as simple as pretending to be sick for school.
271	11	We approached the security and I went up to one of the guards, saying I felt like I was going to throw up and where was the closest bathroom.
271	12	They pointed across the metal detectors, and I turned to my gf and asked her if she could drag all the stuff through.
271	13	She said sure, and I took off my belt and watch and put them on the conveyor belt.
271	14	I felt it a smart move to leave one or two things on, instead of just briskly walking through, giving off the illusion that I had not planned for this sickness.
271	15	This whole time, the rat was in my belly pocket, not having fun.
271	16	I concealed it, somewhat, by sucking in my gut for the longest time I've ever had to suck in a gut, and holding my belly as if I was not feeling well.
271	17	The plan was executed flawlessly.
271	18	I walked through, no alarms, went into the bathroom, waited a little bit, then came out.
271	19	Gf had already made it through and was waiting for me.
271	20	We walked to our gate and waited for the plane, the whole time trying to consolidate the rat by sneaking bits of cracker into the pocket.
271	21	She was not happy and was actively trying to eat her way out.
271	22	Once on the plane, I fumbled to get her out (thankfully had a window seat, otherwise other passengers might get some strange ideas (stranger than the ones they must have already had about this sweaty but smiling and happy guy carrying a cat crate)) and stuck her in the carrier, where she quickly burrowed into the clothes I put in there, out of sight.
271	23	When someone would ask about the animal in there (as two stewardesses did), we merely said it was a kitten and probably was scared, did not want to come out.
271	24	They would look in and see nothing but clothes.
271	25	Put the carrier at my feet, ate some peanuts, and not a single fuck was given that day.
271	26	That rat ended up living another two years to the ripe old age of 3 and a half.
271	27	One day, I heard her squeak really loud, and found her lying on her side.
271	28	I picked her up, held her real close to my face, comforted her and said it was all going to be ok, and felt her final tiny little rat breaths against my eyelid.
271	29	She was a good rat... *sniff*.
272	0	Last year, my family went to Zacatecas, Mexico for the holidays with an uncle of mines from Wisconsin.
272	1	Somehow my uncle had a handgun there which is highly illegal, he got drunk and was firing off some rounds in the air.
272	2	My parents freaked out and when my uncle was not looking, my mom got the unloaded gun and hid it in her luggage.
272	3	Somehow she managed to forget about it.
272	4	They took a plane from Guadalajara to Tijuana then were picked up and came back by car home.
272	5	My family was unpacking and my mom instantly freaked out, there was a handgun in her luggage.
272	6	She successfully smuggled out a handgun from Mexico to the United States.
272	7	tl:dr My mom is a weapons smuggler.
273	0	as I was exiting a Best Buy, I walked around a woman that was having security check her receipt as she left.
273	1	She was carrying an appliance, so I held the door open for her.
273	2	As she was walking through the door, I heard her talking in her cell phone about how some rude asshole just ran around her to leave the store (me).
273	3	Hearing this, I said, "Excuse me?
273	4	I was holding the door for you, you fucking idiot.
273	5	I hope you get hit by a bus!

274	6	Sorry I missed you, call you later.
274	7	Bye.
274	8	" And then I hung up and left the house.
274	9	I made no other calls.
274	10	Later that day he called back and he says, "Wow, that was quite a message you left.
274	11	Who was that girl you were talking to?
274	12	" I was like, "What are you talking about?
274	13	I wasn't talking to any girl!
274	14	" Well, as it turns out the message didn't end after I said "Bye".
274	15	I had to go over to his house and listen to this message a few times.
274	16	After my initial message that I did leave (as quoted above) there was a slight pause and it continues on for another 30-40 seconds or so with me talking to some girl.
274	17	It was my voice, but a conversation I never had with a girl whose voice I didn't recognize.
274	18	You could compare it to the message I know I did leave and the two voices were indistinguishable.
274	19	Not just the voice but, you know, talking mannerisms.
274	20	It was my voice.
274	21	Also, references to my occupation and activities were the same.
274	22	Basically, in this conversation I was talking to this girl about going skiing
274	23	but I had to go down to my shop and work on a car first, which totally correlated to me.
274	24	Then the message just stopped.
274	25	It was recorded on one of those digital answering machines that recorded the message to a chip so there was no tape I could have taken and had analyzed, unfortunately.
274	26	Also, neither I nor my friend had party lines so that's not an explanation.
274	27	It was very freaky, I can't explain it.
275	0	This story is about my friend's friend.
275	1	One night when my friend was working, all of his friends took a bunch of mushrooms and ran through a park.
275	2	Nothing too strange yet.
275	3	The next morning, my friend was eating breakfast and his roomate, one of the mushroom takers from the previous night, we'll call him Jim, came downstairs and told him a crazy story.
275	4	Supposedly he had gotten so high from the mushrooms that he had a dream he found a leprachaun and captured it.
275	5	He had taken it home and locked it in his closet.
275	6	Well, later that day Jim heard weird noises coming from his closet.
275	7	He had been smoking weed all day so he was pretty freaked out at the noises, more so than a sober individual.
275	8	He got my friend to hold a bat and they opened the closet.
275	9	Inside the closet was a mentally challenged young boy, about 5 years old.
275	10	Naturally, my friend and Jim freaked the fuck out.
275	11	They didn't want to get in trouble, but they couldn't keep the kid, so they took him to the police and told the officers that they found the kid wandering around.
275	12	Aparantly the kid has downs syndrome and was reported missing the previous afternoon.
275	13	My friend and his roomate received a $1000 reward for safely returning the missing child to his family.
276	0	This was a huge scandal in China a while back when i was living in Shanghai.
276	1	An elderly lady was crossing the street and was hit by a guy on a scooter.
276	2	She fell down was was injured while the man who hit her drove off.
276	3	A man nearby saw what happened and came over to help her up and offered to take her to a hospital.
276	4	The old lady freaked out and started accusing the man of hitting her which he didnt.
276	5	Her reasoning was "why are you offering to help me if you didn't knock me down in the first place".
276	6	She pressed charges and took him to court and it was a media frenzy in China.
276	7	I don't know what actually happened from the court case since you know the Chinese tend to make news stories mysteriously disappear if it gains too much attention
277	0	Back in high school, me and some other reprobates were having one of our bi-weekly cafetera chairfights and things got even more out of hand than usual.
277	1	We were winging the chairs along the concrete floor at each other and trying to defend ourselves with stacks of other chairs.
277	2	Right when one of the noon-hour supervisors came into the cafeteria a chair I had thrown took a weird bounce and smacked into the candy and chip vending machine.
277	3	The plexiglass (as it turns out it was) pops out and exposes the entire selection to the open air.
277	4	While everyone is staring in stunned silence, the supervisor runs in front of it with her arms spread and yells, "NOBODY TOUCH ANYTHING!
277	5	"
277	6	Everyone in the cafeteria hears this as, "TAKE EVERYTHING YOU CAN!
277	7	" and mobs the vending machine, shuffling the poor woman to the back.
277	8	In the ensuing confusion my compatriots
277	9	and I were able to make our escape.
278	0	When I was 15 and a half, me and my friends snuck out and took my dad's car.
278	1	I only had my permit so it was dangerous but worth it.
278	2	When we were on our way to a party we were told about, I made a stupid driving error and the one car on the road that barely saw me, was a cop.
278	3	I continued driving for a couple of blocks then turned into a residential area.
278	4	I was scared shitless because I knew I was going to be in huge trouble.
278	5	The cop asked me for my license, I said I didn't have it(I meant as in at all, he must've thought that I forgot it).
278	6	He then asked me and my friends for separate I.D.
278	7	and for me to write my name and address on a piece of paper, I was so scared my hand was shaking and I dropped the pen.
278	8	He walked to his car and for what seemed like an eternity we waited.
278	9	The cop came back, gave me a test to see if I'd been drinking and then told me I could go.
278	10	I was so shocked it took me 30 minutes to be able to think straight to drive.
279	0	I lent a very good friend about $500 , his parents were fairly well off
279	1	and I knew his parents sent him a huge check every birthday because we would always travel right after he got the check (annual $10k gift parents are allowed to distribute tax free to their kids)
279	2	so I knew I would get it back in a few weeks.
279	3	Being mindful I told him under no uncertain terms that this was a loan and expected to be paid back by X Date, period.
279	4	He agreed.
279	5	Well, payback date came and passed and nothing yet his birthday was about two weeks after so I waited until after his birthday.
279	6	Still no check.
279	7	I called him on it and asked what happened.
279	8	I got lie after lie.
279	9	First his checking account was compromised then he needed to order checks.
279	10	Then he was waiting for his parents' check to arrive.
279	11	He even went as far as sending me a check on a closed account (stupid because I knew from talking to him the account was closed
279	12	and he didn't bank there anymore
279	13	and it had his old address on it from 2 years ago).
279	14	I asked him why he would send me a check on a closed account and I got yelled at for "not being a good friend" and not being "supportive of his problems".
279	15	I was very nice to him until this point, but I let him have it, "I'm not a good friend??
279	16	I send you $500 so you can pay your rent and don't say a word for weeks and you say I'm not supportive?
279	17	A good friend would pay me back without the lies and forcing me to call you and ask you for the money!
279	18	" I had a check in the mail the same week and haven't talked to him since.
279	19	P. if you're reading this...FUCK YOU.
280	0	About 15 years ago I used to go into a Starbucks around the corner from my then boyfriend's house.
280	1	I went in grudgingly because it was very busy and touristy AND there was one particular "barrista" that fucking enraged me.
280	2	He was the most self-righteous, put-out, indignant, huffy little fuck to ever stand behind a coffee machine.
280	3	Boston is lousy with philosophy spewing undergrads and he was their self-appointed king.
280	4	So one morning I walk in this Starbucks in a particularly bad mood.
280	5	As I'm waiting for my tea, the little fucker launches into some overwrought drama with a coworker and I said, "listen dude, can I have my drink before this goes any further?
280	6	" He loses it on me: yelling, blaming, using big words... the whole victim shebang.
280	7	In the end, he 86s me and tells me that I'm never to step foot inside his castle of coffee again.
280	8	Fast forward a few weeks, in a different Starbucks, and I notice that they've begun to use stamp cards (10 stamps and the next coffee is free).
280	9	So as I'm leaving, I swipe the official Starbucks stamp from the counter... and proceed to stamp HUNDREDS of cards that summer.
280	10	I was the summer intern for a company and made sure that not one person in that office ever paid for coffee.
280	11	I stamped so much that I had to purchase a green stamp pad expressly for the Starbucks stamp.
280	12	Treat me badly and I'll steal your fucking stamp.
280	13	It's really the little victories in this life.
281	0	had a somewhat similar thing said about me but different circumstances.
281	1	Was driving home middle of winter at night on a busy street.
281	2	This lady is stopped in the left lane im coming up behind her and thinking she is turning but didnt turn on her blinkers i go around her.
281	3	As im going by her looking infront of me i see this white thing in the road that i think is just snow.
281	4	as im going over it, it turns and looks at me and its a fucking little dog all white.
281	5	i go over it.
281	6	i immediantly pull into the nearest driveway which isnt to close but still visable from the lady in the car.
281	7	i walk over to check on the dog which is visibly shaken but not injured short of a small bleeding scratch on its head probably from a hangar that was holding my muffler on.
281	8	Me and this guy who i dont know are trying to keep the dog warm and safe from more traffic but its trying to bite us so we aint trying to pick it up.
281	9	The owner shows up after a few minutes and the lady who was stopped in the left lane comes out of her car.
281	10	Guy asks what happened boyfriend tells him then the lady says and the guy who hit him didnt even stop just drove off and shes all freaking out and shit.
281	11	Soon as she said it im like i was the one who hit him.
281	12	I look at the owner and apologize then give the owner a blanket from my car to put the dog in to get it off the street and warm it up and my business card and offer him a ride home.
281	13	The lady the whole time just talking shit about me for hitting a dog she basically made me hit by stopping on a busy road and making me go around her she didnt have caution lights on or anything so i thought for sure she was just some ahole who didnt put their blinker on to turn.
281	14	The owner was cool about it all though and thanked me for stopping and trying to keep the dog warm and from further injury.
281	15	Ladys boyfriend was also cool and thought it was somewhat sad situation nothing bad really happened dog was alright just scared shitless as i bet i would have been if i was him also lol.
281	16	Owner asked us to keep a lookout for his other dog said he had two and both got out both were white and small.
281	17	Never found the other one though i went to look just hoping i could save the other from getting hurt or worse.
282	0	Once I was at a party and a girl started taunting me saying some racist bullshit and being a bitch.
282	1	I was tanked so I got all defensive and started mocking her and stuff.
282	2	It escalated and for some reason she said "I bet you couldn't even get on the shed roof!
282	3	", probably just because she knew I would totally try to do it out of spite.
282	4	So in the back corner of the yard there was this rickety little shed, and leaning against the fence was a ladder.
282	5	Too easy, I thought.
282	6	So to make it interesting, I climbed the ladder while it was leaning on the fence, twisted around it, kicked off the fence and kind of swung through the air and landed on the shed.
282	7	As I stood and taunted her from the roof the rest of the party goers applauded and laughed.
282	8	I was elated, but then the roof suddenly collapsed and I fell into it, only to become stuck hip-deep in a tool shed.
282	9	But I didn't mind - I simply continued to taunt her from there.
282	10	Oh and I banged her later that night.
283	0	A buddy of mine blew the motor in his truck.
283	1	I knew of a engine 200 miles away that would be a good replacement.
283	2	So I drive there pay $250 for it load in my truck and drive back.
283	3	I leave the motor at the local shop and it gets put in the truck.
283	4	One week later he sells the truck and never pays me for the motor.
283	5	&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
284	0	About 10 years back I was introduced to weed by a few friends.
284	1	One of them was named George (not really name for obvious reasons).
284	2	George and I smoked together a few more times at his house with little to no problems, but one night it all changed.
284	3	We both pitched in on rolling a blunt, and smoked it on his couch until we both got pretty high.
284	4	He had previously been in encounters with other men, but I had made it very clear I was not interested in that, I just liked his company.
284	5	Anyways, we were enjoying ourselves watching Star Wars on his t.v, when suddenly he pulls of his pants and starts masturbating in front of me.
284	6	I scorned him to stop immediately (I knew he was at least at an [8] so I cut him some slack) or I would leave.
284	7	He then proceeds to look me directly in the eyes, which creeped me the fuck out, and asked me to help him finish.
284	8	I got up without saying a word and rushed to the door.
284	9	Unfortunately I underestimated his speed, both for movement, and masturbating.
284	10	Time itself froze, he came towards me (no pun intended) and released what seemed like a life time build up of lust.
284	11	Somehow I managed to jolt to the left, allowing me to dodge the spray that eventually covered the door.
284	12	We both stood still for what seemed like an eternity, until he collapsed in a pool of his own filth.
284	13	This gave me enough time to rush to the backdoor, were I made my narrow escape..or so it seemed.
284	14	I realized I had forgotten my keys on the couch where the incident had begun.
284	15	I didn't know what to do.
284	16	Since it was close to -10F outside and my house was more than 20 miles away, I had no other option.
284	17	I quickly and quietly ventured back inside, heart-racing, and with a sense alertness I had never felt before.
284	18	I spotted my keys lying on the edge of the couch, and made the poor choice of glancing at the door I had earlier tried to escape through.
284	19	He was gone.
284	20	Evidence still covered the scene, but he was gone.
284	21	I lunged to grab my keys, and just as I did, he appeared from behind the couch.
284	22	It was now a life and death situation.
284	23	Like a gazelle being chased by a hungry lion, I darted as quickly as I could for the backdoor, being chased by what was now a fully naked George who was furiously masturbating.
284	24	We've all seen those horror movies where the victim being chased by an ax murderer frantically fumbles with their keys, trying to open their car door.
284	25	Fortunately this was not one of those situations, and I made my narrow escape.
284	26	The last time I ever saw him was from my rear-view mirror, masturbating in the snowfall.
285	0	One time I accidentally went to a gay orgy.
285	1	So, one night I was invited by two buddies (who happened to be gay) to a pool party.
285	2	This sounded fun
285	3	so I decided to come along.
285	4	The first friend was called Nat and we are both socially awkward so this was not out forte
285	5	but our other friend Brad was a bit more outgoing and he got us to go.
285	6	Anyway, we got there to find it was actually a nude hot tub party.
285	7	No biggie, I'm comfortable with my body.
285	8	We were hanging out with the people there (some of whom were a bit older.
285	9	Kinda weird but whatever) and our fiend Brad was nowhere to be found.
285	10	I asked someone if he knew where Brad was and he said yes and asked us to come upstairs to meet him.
285	11	We entered a room upstairs to find a full blown (no pun intended) orgy going on.
285	12	Nat and I were stunned and stood there awkwardly for a moment.
285	13	We were then instructed to "join in or get out" and were happy to to the latter.
285	14	We went back downstairs to awkwardly wait of Brad to finish.
285	15	And that's the story of how I accidentally went to a gay orgy.
286	0	oooo, I've got a good one for this.
286	1	To start, I'm a straight dude, and I used to work at Victorias Secret.
286	2	No, not selling things on the floor- stock boy.
286	3	Pinning security tags on things, moving heavy boxes, climbing ladders, squashing bugs.
286	4	I thought them kinda sexist or unfemenistic for literally saying that last bit in the interview, but they turned out to have some spiders that were about 5 inches wide when you counted the legs...
286	5	so i kinda understood after seeing that.
286	6	Killed the thing with a box, cause I was worried that if I tried to step on it.... it might win.
286	7	Anyways, back on point.
286	8	So my manager that day was this lady that was pregnant.
286	9	as.
286	10	hell.
286	11	But a very chill pregnant lady- handled the pain and the moodswings oddly well.
286	12	Cheerful and straightforward, at 7 months preggers.
286	13	This woman comes up for an exchange- no big deal.
286	14	Manager types up the ticket, and goes to take the security tags off the new clothes and the woman cuts her off-
286	15	"NONONOONONONNO DONT TOUCH IT"
286	16	"Oh....uh...
286	17	I need to take the tags off so you can leave with it"
286	18	"NONONO DON'T TOUCH IT
286	19	I DONT WANNA GET PREGNANT!!
286	20	"
286	21	"....I...
286	22	uh... you can't get pregnant that way...."
286	23	"PLEASE DONT TOUCH IT, IF YOU TOUCH IT AND THEN I TOUCH IT I CAN GET PREGNANT, I HAVEN'T HAD SEX IN 3 YEARS AND I DON'T
286	24	WANNA GET PREGNANT!
286	25	"
286	26	".........I'll get one of the other girls to help you!
286	27	"
286	28	So she grabs one of the non-pregnant workers, and gets them to finish out the return.
286	29	She then comes into the back, because holy shit, that actually just happened, and someone needs to hear about it.
286	30	So she comes into the back to tell me about it.
286	31	She has some trouble getting her words together, mostly just making those "I can't believe this just happened" faces.
286	32	While she's getting herself together to tell this story, (none of which I know at this point, btdubs), and into the employees-only-backroom walks in that same lady.
286	33	She starts to ask a question, but then notices me.
286	34	"Ooooohhhhh, you dooooo have a boy working here!
286	35	"
286	36	She then proceeds to dump out her newly purchased lingerie on a nearby box.
286	37	"Would you touch it?
286	38	" as she motions to the lingerie.
286	39	I try to awkwardly laugh it off as though it's a joke.
286	40	She stares at me unflinchingly.
286	41	Awkward silence comes over the room as this woman clearly will not leave until I touch her lingerie.
286	42	I pick it up, fold it neatly, and put it back in her bag.
286	43	The woman leaves.
286	44	Manager then proceeds to tell me the previous story about how the woman thought she could catch pregnancy by touching something a pregnant woman touched, and I start to freak out a little.
286	45	THEN WHY WAS SHE SO DETERMINED TO HAVE ME TOUCH HER LINGERIE????
286	46	The woman returned to the store 3 times that day.
286	47	Each time, making a beeline for the backroom, only to be intercepted by my managers, who would politely ask if she needed anything, and then she would leave.
286	48	I left out the back door that night.
286	49	Super kudos to the wonderful women that worked there.
287	0	i had a letter in my mailbox, so i opened it as i tend to do with things i find in my mailbox.
287	1	i hadn't realised that the name on the envelope was someone i'd never heard of.
287	2	but the address was correct except there was a unit # even tho i live in a townhouse.
287	3	it was three passports and cash with a letter from Canada Customs and Immigration.
287	4	I decided to take a shot in the dark and try the building across the street and found her name in the building directory.
287	5	she came down, and proceeded to give me shit for opening her letter.
287	6	i told her it was an accident and that everything is still there.
287	7	but it had no effect on her.
287	8	i said, "no problem.
287	9	any future letters for you will go in the garbage unopened.
287	10	" and walked away.
287	11	but even if i did get another letter for her, i'd prolly still drop it off..
288	0	I use to work for a tent company and we would set up for weddings.
288	1	One in particular comes to mind....
288	2	It was 95 degrees out, middle of July, and we were all suffering.
288	3	This was a large wedding, with a large tent, stage, dance floor, tables, chairs, plates, silverware, lights, ect.
288	4	We arrived at her parents house at 7am.
288	5	She was all nice and calm, said that she would buy us all lunch (6 or 7 guys) at around noon to thank us for our hard work.
288	6	She also said that she would bring us water since it was so hot out and we could tap into the keg when we were done.
288	7	Great deal right?
288	8	Wrong.
288	9	About noon we had gotten the tent up, the lighting done, the stage and dance floor partially set up.
288	10	She came running out saying that we needed to move the tent 3 feet.
288	11	Yes, we needed to move the 240' by 60' tent 3 feet.
288	12	My initial response was, "are you kidding me?
288	13	" She wasn't.
288	14	After talking it over with her we decided to move the tent (we had too, the customer is always right even when they say this is where I want the tent to go, we put it up and she changes her mind).
288	15	We take it down, move the tent 3 feet and put it back up.
288	16	It is now pushing 8 pm.
288	17	Still no water, lunch or dinner.
288	18	10 pm rolls around and we are unloading tables.
288	19	She comes storming out saying, "You are making too much noise!!!
288	20	BE QUIET.
288	21	"
288	22	One guy I worked with asked, "Can we please get some water now, we drank all of the water that we brought"
288	23	She goes, "Umm....
288	24	The hose is around back, take some but not too much, water is expensive.
288	25	"
288	26	We never got a lunch, dinner or beer.
288	27	This lady was a bitch.
288	28	We worked from 7 am to 11 pm at her house (not to mention the 45ish minute drive to and from her house).
288	29	I never had a problem with working those type of hours if people tipped us, gave us food and thanked us.
288	30	She didn't do anything.
289	0	Saved a girl on an escalator when she go her heel stuck and fell backwards.
289	1	Queue me feeling like a badass thinking I just pulled some serious Hugh grant shit ready for all the sex.
289	2	She accuses me of assaulting her and grabbing her ass and boob and trying to sexually assault her.
289	3	Some big ass security guard hears commotion and pulls me to one side.
289	4	Nobody lifts a finger to back me up.
289	5	Police called.
289	6	Thank fuck for CCTV.
290	0	One school day, a boy named Tom was sitting in class and doing math.
290	1	It was six more minutes until after school.
290	2	As he was doing his homework, something caught his eye.
290	3	His desk was next to the window, and he turned and looked to the grass outside.
290	4	It looked like a picture.
290	5	When school was over, he ran to the spot where he saw it.
290	6	He ran fast so that no one else could grab it.
290	7	He picked it up and smiled.
290	8	It had a picture of the most beautiful girl he had ever seen.
290	9	She had a dress with tights on and red shoes, and her hand was formed into a peace sign.
290	10	She was so beautiful he wanted to meet her, so he ran all over the school and asked everyone if they knew her or have ever seen her before.
290	11	But everyone he asked said "No.
290	12	" He was devastated.
290	13	When he was home, he asked his older sister if she knew the girl, but unfortunately she also said "No.
290	14	" It was very late, so Tom walked up the stairs, placed the picture on his bedside table and went to sleep.
290	15	In the middle of the night Tom was awakened by a tap on his window.
290	16	It was like a nail tapping.
290	17	He got scared.
290	18	After the tapping he heard a giggle.
290	19	He saw a shadow near his window, so he got out of his bed, walked toward his window, opened it up and followed the giggling.
290	20	By the time he reached it, it was gone.
290	21	The next day again he asked his neighbors if they knew her.
290	22	Everybody said, "Sorry, no.
290	23	" When his mother came home he even asked her if she knew her.
290	24	She said "No.
290	25	" He went to his room, placed the picture on his desk and fell asleep.
290	26	Once again he was awakened by a tapping.
290	27	He took the picture and followed the giggling.
290	28	He walked across the road, when suddenly he got hit by a car.
290	29	He was dead with the picture in his hand.
290	30	The driver got out of the car and tried to help him, but it was too late.
290	31	Suddenly he saw the picture and picked it up.
290	32	He saw a cute girl holding up three fingers.
291	0	My SO at the time had been depressed/suicidal
291	1	and I had been making posts in relevant subs with a different account asking for advice.
291	2	I didn't really have any experience with depression/suicide at the time, so it was a very scary situation for me.
291	3	A close friend of mine who uses Reddit pretty heavily saw one of the posts and figured out it was me because I had shared some of the details with him.
291	4	I was surprised/embarrassed at first that I had been so obvious, but it ended up being good because I got to confide in him about my situation, which is all I really wanted to do.
292	0	So me and my friend decide to go explore this old group of houses (probably from 1930s) anyway the main house has three stories and is so overgrown a fully grown tree is blocking the door.
292	1	Naturally the only other way to get in is through the cellar doors.
292	2	So we go down using nothing but our phone lights and it wasnt really creepy at all although the cieling was low (about 5ft high).
292	3	So we go to the second floor and once again there is nothing.
292	4	No furniture or trash...just nothing so we go upstairs
292	5	and it's the same story however at this point the two of us realize the place is spotless and has none of the normal dust and dirt.
292	6	Nope, it was immaculate which is creepy in itself.
292	7	So we go upstairs and nothing once again.
292	8	We do however notice a peice of plywood has been screwed into the wall and so obviously we rip it off to see what lies behind.
292	9	What we found was the stairs to the attic.
292	10	When we went to the attic there was a single chair sitting facing out of the only window in the attic.
292	11	So I'm superstitious and am scared shitless but my friend sits down in the fair and realizes that it's placed facing the roller rink across the highway....pretty creepy.
292	12	I have more stories about the other buildings on the property if you guys want
293	0	This happened a while back I had a "friend".
293	1	He was a foster child he came to my house allot.
293	2	We hung out for a few years.
293	3	My mom took him places like local amusement parks, pools, parks, etc.
293	4	I change schools and slowly stop hanging out.
293	5	a year or so goes by since I've seen him.
293	6	He shows up at my door out of the blue we talk a little bit remissness about past the past he leaves after a half hour or so.
293	7	next week I'm sleeping hear the door bell, I look to see him out the window
293	8	so I open the door.
293	9	Next thing I know he punched me in the face and knocks me to the ground holds a knife to me.
293	10	At this time another person who I had not seen when I looked out comes in with a gun.
293	11	I tell them I'm not fighting back.
293	12	he ties me up, robs me and says how he hates me and how its my fault for this.
293	13	I asked what I had done he tells me I had .
293	14	shown him what a good life was
293	15	and he knew he could never have it.
293	16	he punches me a couple times more then leaves me tied up to a pole in my basement.
293	17	I of course got out and called the police he got arrested the second guy never did.
293	18	All I ever did to him was try to be a friend and he did that to me I can't get how some people can be so evil.
294	0	I was cashing out a client who came into the salon with her mother.
294	1	When I came back to the register to cash them out, there were two Asian ladies in front of me.
294	2	One of them was visibly older than the other one.
294	3	Since they were the only two people at the register, I assumed they were the duo I was supposed to cash out.
294	4	I confirmed, "Are you together?
294	5	" The younger lady went into a rage, cursing me out for being racist and assuming all Asians looked the same.
294	6	Turns out, the older lady wasn't her mother, and was just trying to buy a bottle of shampoo.
294	7	It was awful.
295	0	My mom got remarried when I was 15.
295	1	it was a shotgun wedding too 'cause her new husband got her pregnant about 8 months before.
295	2	My sister and I move in with them to their new house...
295	3	Fast foreword to 3 yrs later, sis and I do almost EVERYTHING around the house including taking care of the half-pint.
295	4	Mom's husband is a controlling and suspicious dipshit.
295	5	Everytime the kid cries and I'm in the same room it's automatically MY FAULT.
295	6	Hp would cry about Anything!
295	7	Loud noise, funny colors, he would walk into the living room and start Bawling at the sight of me and my sister watching TV and the jerk would come charging in like a fucking bull and demand to know what happened to his son...
295	8	Mom didn't do shit when he started yelling at us.
295	9	One time the asshole was slamming the door behind him when he was going out back to the grill.
295	10	Half-pint has his hand on the door frame.
295	11	I grab his wrist and move his hand away just before the door could crush his fingers.
295	12	He starts screaming at the top of his lungs.
295	13	My mom saw the whole thing but she doesn't say anything when her husband starts yelling at me and accusing me of hurting his Son.
295	14	I can't get a word in edgewise.
295	15	My sister steps in and speaks for me instead.
295	16	He tells her to shut up.
295	17	It's then that my mom stepped in and told him He nearly hurt hp not me.
295	18	He goes back to grilling like nothing happened.
295	19	I kept my brother's fingers from getting squished and got yelled at and nearly beaten for it.
296	0	I used to work in a building that had three levels of sub-basements, with the piece of lab equipment I typically worked on in the lowest basement.
296	1	I had the only key.
296	2	There was a wired phone in there, and I did work late some nights... but not this night.
296	3	I was sleeping alone in my apartment when I woke up to a call on my cell phone from my girlfriend at 3 AM, she was in hysterics and asking why I scared her.
296	4	Apparently she received a call from that basement phone just a minute earlier, with someone who sounded like me slowly repeating her name, until crackling and fading out.
296	5	My apartment was 10 miles away from work.
296	6	I thought she was lying, but I saw the 3 AM call from the basement phone logged on her cell myself.
296	7	Still freaks me the fuck out.
297	0	This story was told to me by a girl who I recently moved in with.
297	1	It happened to her a few years ago and when she told me about it sent shivers down my spine.
297	2	She was attending the biggest Irish horse racing meeting of the year known as "The Galway Races"- it is a basically a huge piss up where the whole city goes to the pub and gambles for several days.
297	3	People from all over the country come to Galway city and usually end up staying outside of the city in rural areas as everywhere is booked up in the city itself.
297	4	This girl in particular was staying in a small house on a narrow, secluded country lane with a friend of hers.
297	5	One night she and her friend came home quite drunk and they realised that they had no key to get in to the house.
297	6	They sat down at the front of the house and had a rest while trying to figure out what to do.
297	7	She told me she had a very strange feeling that something was wrong at this stage and instantly sobered up.
297	8	The road was completely quiet and there was no street lamps as it was not a main road.
297	9	The two girls walked down the road a hundred yards or so to the next house and knocked on the door.
297	10	After a few minutes the neighbour answered the door and gave them a spare key she had.
297	11	The girls then went home and went straight to bed.
297	12	The next morning they looked out the window to see two police cars outside and a line of police tape cordoning off the narrow road.
297	13	They spoke to the officers who told them that a man had been walking home from the races and was hit by a car outside there door.
297	14	The officers then explained that the man had been killed in a hit and run and was lying on the ground still alive throughout the night.
297	15	They also said he was struck before the time when they had arrived home.
297	16	Meaning that they had been sitting several feet from the dieing man when they rested on the doorstep.
297	17	I have been following reddit for a year now but only signed up today as I was reading all these spooky stories and decided to share this one with you all.
297	18	I hope you like it and that my reddiquette is up to scratch.
298	0	I know of a story.
298	1	A friend of mine is an EMT and he responded to a call of a sex session gone horribly wrong.
298	2	For some reason, they wanted to do some role reversal, and so the male insisted that the female shove a coke bottle in her vagina and let him suck it like a penis.
298	3	So, he shook it up, shoved it in, and opened it, and it got his face all wet.
298	4	Apparently though, it also got lodged in her vagina.
298	5	They didn't realize it until later...when it got worse.
298	6	They tried anal, and the neck of the bottle got stuck in his anus and so when they called 911, the EMTs found them naked, attached from her vagina to his ass.
299	0	I used to give rides to my roommate too and from work whenever possible.
299	1	It was a 60 mile round trip.
299	2	He gave me $10/week for gas but that was maybe a third of what it actually cost me to drive him.
299	3	I didn't raise much of a fuss about it even though it was costing me money and pretty inconvenient to me most days
299	4	I was working 10-12 hour days at the time and couldn't take much time off of work.
299	5	I came down with a nasty flu that knocked me on my ass.
299	6	I ended up sleeping instead of picking him up from work that night.
299	7	The next day, he sends me half a dozen text messages telling me that I have a "severe lack of accountability" and basically calls me lazy, irresponsible etc.
299	8	I wanted to throw him out a window.
300	0	On my way to work through 5 Points Station in Atlanta, I stopped to get something to eat.
300	1	After stuffing my face, a kid about my age (20-22) came up to me and asked me for some money for some food.
300	2	Generally I don't give out money, but I could tell this kid was legit just hungry.
300	3	I pull out my wallet, hand the kid 5 bucks, hand-shake with a quick bro-hug, and he starts walking into the fast-food joint.
300	4	As soon as I turn around, 3 cops throw me onto the ground, yank the kid out of the restaurant, and detain us.
300	5	At this point I've got scraps on my face and elbows where they threw me onto the pavement and a bruise forming on my thigh from where they kneed me to chop me down (I'm 6'2).
300	6	While in custody they find a lot of weed and some bags on the kid.
300	7	**This is where they begin to tell me that they're going to find the bag I dropped outside and proceed to pull out a bag from the kid's weed bag, look at each other and laugh.
300	8	This convinced me I need to write what they want on the report**; so I did.
300	9	Next day at the kids arraignment, the prosecutor asks me about my statement.
300	10	I recant with some choice words.
300	11	He has to drop the case and both I and the kid walk.
300	12	I filed a complaint.
301	0	In the dorms I lived in my first year in college there were about 15 private bathrooms that were shared by the floor instead of one big one.
301	1	Once my roommate went in one and found a laptop just sitting in there.
301	2	He was going to take it to our floor's Residence Adviser, but it was 8:00 am so instead of waking her up, he put it in our dorm so he could give it to her after his classes.
301	3	The owner apparently reported it stolen and while my roommate was in class, a police officer went around dorm-to-dorm asking if anyone had seen it.
301	4	When he came to our dorm my other roommate answered and said "Oh yeah, it's right here.
301	5	" The cop took it and returned it to the owner.
301	6	Later that day, the cop returned and wanted to know more about how it ended up in our dorm.
301	7	By now, the roommate that found it was back and told the cop what happened.
301	8	The cop took him to the police station and put him in an interrogation room and everything.
301	9	After repeated questioning, my roommate mentioned that he had left a note on our whiteboard to let us know in case anyone came looking for it.
301	10	The cop called my roommate to verify that the note was there and everything ended happily after that but it was scary as shit for my roommate.
302	0	When I was 10, we had to paint birds for art, I was pretty good at art but a girl copied my exact one, even though we had to do different ones
302	1	and I was not pleased.
302	2	So while we were cleaning up paint brushes, (the painted birds were placed nearby), I put her painting in the sink with the tap running, pretended it accidentally fell in there and walked away like nothing happened.
302	3	I think she got the message.
303	0	I've been trucking in the oilfield for 2 years now.
303	1	I narrowly avoided a head on collision with a single prop plane, had a brake pod blow off a truck in front of me and fire past me at an insane speed, seen a coworker go into a ditch during a blizzard and jump a lease road and get a good 10 feet of air, fully loaded 40 ton unit do a complete 360 and stay on the road and kept going like nothing happened.
303	2	I've gone down a hill jackknife at 70 km/h and some how recover.
303	3	I've seen some shit, man...
304	0	Made one to write about a breakup.
304	1	Wound was pretty fresh and I was venting.
304	2	Past lover found it, laughed in my face about it and showed all of their friends.
304	3	I guess the consequence was that it made the whole situation a little more shitty.
304	4	But when you've hit the bottom, there isn't that much further to go.
304	5	I'm doing really well now though, so that's nice.
305	0	I was taking a plane to North Carolina last summer for my friend's wedding.
305	1	NC was a neutral location, and I wanted to have some cannabis with me, so I decided to smuggle some on the plane.
305	2	I've done this a bunch, it's not that hard.
305	3	I bought a brand new pack of cigs, undid the cellophane from the bottom end, took the pack out, opened it from the bottom, took out some cigs, emptied the tobacco, replaced it with herb, put some tobacco at the end, put the cigs back in the pack from the bottom, closed it and resealed the cellophane.
305	4	I just had to put that in my carry-on and I'd be good to go, eazy peazy.
305	5	I get to the airport, psych myself up to go through security, and get through with no problem.
305	6	I felt like [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QCcMTHCBJ4c/TR3UxhJNKUI/AAAAAAAAEc4/aRgl1iocltI/s1600/Funniest%2BHappy%2BLeo.jpeg) as I got through without issue.
305	7	I board my plane and am situating my self when I look down and notice that I'm wearing a shirt with a front pocket and there is something in it.
305	8	I reach in and pull out my HEAVILY used, sticky as shit grinder.
305	9	It was just sitting in my front pocket the entire time and I got through security with no issue.
305	10	I laughed pretty hard, people thought I was weird.
305	11	Also one time my friend accidentally put a HUGE kitchen knife (like 12" long) in her carry-on and forgot about it.
305	12	It was a pretty funny scene at security when they pulled it out.
305	13	I was laughing, she was terrified.
306	0	I'm sure this one has happened to everybody, but I was still awake at 2am (on Reddit of course).
306	1	Bars are closing.
306	2	My buddy calls me up to come pick him and he female friend up.
306	3	I pick both of them up.
306	4	Both had a lot to drink.
306	5	I'm on my way to dropping them off and she pukes in the back of my car.
306	6	I EVEN GAVE HER A PLASTIC BAG TO PUKE IN!
306	7	But some of it missed and got on my seats, the floor, and that little pocket where the seat belt receiver can hide in.
306	8	I used whatever I had in my car to clean up the bulk.
306	9	Dropped them off.
306	10	Went to a grocery store to pick up carpet cleaner and some febreeze to clean it up right away.
306	11	That was one week ago and my car still stinks.
307	0	Edray, WV One night few years back my friend (who is driving) and I were taking his girlfriend home when he decided to take the "long way home".
307	1	As we are driving along this fairly deserted back road I began to zone out and I stare at this blinking red light off in the distance and casually think to myself "I wonder when they built a cell phone tower all the way out here.
307	2	" When suddenly it blinks and is dramatically closer than it was just a moment earlier, at this point my friend points it out and stops in the road.
307	3	It blinks once more and is directly in front and over top of us, the red light is so bright it floods the car in a deep scarlet hue.
307	4	I lean forward so that I can see directly into the light, in that brief moment I feel a flood of negative emotions the closest description I can offer is to that of being naked under a giant microscope and having every pore examined thoroughly.
307	5	I then look away from the light to my friend and ask him to drive, he barely responds apparently in a similar state.
307	6	Then he snaps out of it and starts driving, as we get a little ways down the road I notice the red light isn't fading and the interior of the car is still clearly lit by it.
307	7	I look out the window and to my horror the light is following us and does so for approximately 1-2 miles.
307	8	The light unexpectedly veers off to the left and comes down to ground level in a patch of trees adjacent to the road.
307	9	My friend stops the car again and continues to stare at it and abruptly declares he is going to get out and look it like he is in some sort of trance.
307	10	He opens the door and I grab his arm and tell him if he does I will get in the driver seat and leave him, that we had to leave that instant.
307	11	He looks at me and seems to come to and punches the gas so hard the tires lose traction and spin.
307	12	The light remained stationary as we rode away but I've never looked at the night sky the same.
308	0	Thankfully no one outside my head saw it, but I was waiting in the lobby at work for someone once and just to waste time started flipping through the guest sign in book.
308	1	And found myself giggling that every day at the same time (3:15) Jesus would sign into the guest register.
308	2	Rolled my eyes at some of the religious nuts I work with.
308	3	A few minutes later (3:15) the building's Latin American cleaner came into the lobby, signed himself into the guest book (outsourced employee, so had to sign in), and let himself into the building.
308	4	I just kinda kept quiet and tried not to blush as I realized who "Jesus" actually was.
309	0	When I was 15 I was working as a lifegaurd.
309	1	I see this 10 year old swimming along when a large 14 year old (nearly twice his size) jump right on top of him, knocking him out.
309	2	The kid sinks to the bottom of the pool and I go into action.
309	3	I jump in and pull the kid out of the water and check him for vitals.
309	4	He was not breathing and had no pulse, so I start CPR.
309	5	During one of the chest compressions I hear a load crack.
309	6	At that point I know I just broke 1 or more ribs but continued going until I got him back to consciousness (which is what we are trained to do).
309	7	He comes back as enter arrive on scene and they rush him to the hospital.
309	8	Fast forward 2 weeks while at work on the lifegaurd stand I get approached by this Guy dressed in a nice suit.
309	9	He Asked me if I'm who he was looking for I said "yes what can I do for you?".
309	10	He hands me an envelope and says "show the fuck up to court.
309	11	You've been served.
309	12	" and walks away.
309	13	I open the envelope to find his mother is suing me for injuring her son during CPR.
309	14	Luckily my dad had a friend who was a great attourney.
309	15	That case got dismissed, and we counter sued for defamation, and I got a nice $5000 pay out after months of being called a piece of shit.
310	0	Robbed an old lady drug dealer at gun point.
310	1	The plan was just to get a lbs of weed, but it turned into this huge pain in the ass when we first showed up.
310	2	The woman was a junkie had junkies all in the house I was getting pissed off because she kept giving me and my friend the run around.
310	3	You should of seen he bathroom it was full of holes from the junkies thinking the drywall was drugs.
310	4	She had a 7 year old son that got home from school and she had us watching him when she went out to go get the weed.
310	5	I got even more furious when the little boy told me that her mother makes him play his "video games" on the computer so she can take her "medicine".
310	6	It was fucking solitaire on the computer.
310	7	Anyway she gets back and obviously it's short and somehow I got some pills that I didn't want because I'm guessing she thought she could steal from me.
310	8	So we are in the back room and I pulled out a gun and told her I'm taking everything and the money.
310	9	I'm not paying for shit also told her she was a horrible mother and I'm calling child services.
310	10	She flipped out telling me she will find me and I was a dead man.
310	11	When I left I called child services and never heard anything about it again.
311	0	My first girlfriend was a girl I met through a friend.
311	1	I had always wanted a girlfriend, and I figured shit, it's my freshman year of college, might as well.
311	2	So the second time I partied with this girl I had the balls to ask her to come back to my room.
311	3	I made out with her for awhile, which also happened to be the first time I had ever kissed a girl.
311	4	We dated for around 6 months, and man, I really loved this girl.
311	5	I don't know why.
311	6	We didn't share much in common
311	7	but she though I was an awesome person for how I acted towards other people, and my hobbies.
311	8	So eventually, the summer comes, and she has to move back home for the summer.
311	9	We made it work, and I went to see her, she came to see me.
311	10	My parents loved her, her parents loved me although her mom was a bitch.
311	11	Eventually she just became more distant.. wouldn't respond to my texts, wouldn't really make it out of her way to talk to me.
311	12	I found out through her friends that she'd started hanging out with another guy a lot more.
311	13	I was heart broken that someone could do that to me, such an innocent person at that time.
311	14	She eventually broke up with me because I asked her about it and she thought I was too jealous.
311	15	My second girlfriend was a girl I met through a friend.
311	16	I was ready for another girlfriend, and I was full of sexual energy and shit.
311	17	I never thought I would date this girl, but man she was hot.
311	18	I learned to love her, and she thought I was an awesome person because of how I treated people and because of my hobbies.
311	19	The second time I hung out with her, it was at a friends house.
311	20	We went to the pool and she hopped on my back, and one thing led to another.
311	21	I wanted to have sex with her really bad, and she was my first.
311	22	We dated throughout the school year.
311	23	Anyway, so summer came, and we made it work for the most part.
311	24	My parents loved her and her parents loved me.
311	25	Most of all I really loved her.
311	26	Unfortunately, I found some texts between her and another guy.
311	27	Texts like "I want to be in bed with you" and "I want to do as much for you as I can without you having to do anything ;)" and everyone knows what that damned wink face means.
311	28	I was heart broken that a girl could do this to me after 6 months of exclusive dating.
311	29	I asked her about it and she broke up with me for checking through her phone, which wasn't how it happened.
311	30	That was 3 days ago.
311	31	2 girlfriends over 3 summers, both ending the exact same way.
312	0	Okay this was something I was going to take to the grave with me, but I want to tell someone other than the 2 other people who know it.
312	1	One night when I was 8 my family and I lived in an apartment.
312	2	Now I had 4 people in my family and the apartment had only 2 rooms so my sister and I shared rooms.
312	3	In any case one night I had to pee, but for some reason instead of going to the bathroom I, in my half sleepy/sleep walking state, went on top of my sister's bed and peed on top of her headboard.
312	4	While this was happening, I thought it was a dream as I previously had some episodes of sleep walking and doing some funny things (like turning on the TV or having a non-coherent conversation with my parents), but the next morning arrived and my sister commented that her pillow was all wet and smelled musty and for some reason I couldn't remember that it was because of me.
312	5	Later my mom found out it was pee and I suddenly had a flash back of using my sister as a toilet seat.
312	6	I cried in terror at what I've done and to this day my mom and sister founds it hysterical, but not me.
312	7	I'm haunted to this day at what I've done.
312	8	**TLTR: I gave my sister a golden shower while she was asleep**
313	0	I found a wallet outside on a patio by the smokers area at a bar one time.
313	1	So, as a smoker, I just hung out outside and asked everyone that came back out if they lost their wallet.
313	2	One girl was like "OMG I DID!?
313	3	" I asked her to describe it, she did, and I pulled it out
313	4	and she was like "YOU!?
313	5	YOU TOOK MY FUCKING WALLET?
313	6	" I said "no, it was sitting on that bench right there, figured it was better if I try to find the owner than just let it sit there on a busy Friday night".
313	7	She said "I have every right to call the cops!!!!".
313	8	I just said "Wow, try to do a nice thing for someone..." and threw her wallet into the parking lot and went back inside the bar.
314	0	How I was once mistaken for dead
314	1	and it was hilarious.
314	2	I had a cubicle job during college and in my cubicle was a 3-hole-puncher which I purchased with my own money in order that I might organize my schoolwork into binders during breaks.
314	3	The 3-hole-puncher kept going missing, then I found out that Barb from the call center was "borrowing" it from my desk to make scrapbooks of her ugly grand kids.
314	4	I sent a polite email to the entire department explaining that it was my personal belonging and asked that it not be removed from my desk.
314	5	Not long after, a guy from a department adjacent to mine who looked sort of like me hanged himself to death.
314	6	There were about 300 employees in the branch, and I imagine many conversations circulated that morning which went like "Did you hear that guy from the third floor hanged himself?
314	7	" "No, who?!
314	8	" "You know the quiet guy with glasses and a beard?
314	9	" "Oh no, not pteam-pterodactyl!
314	10	" By the time I got to work that afternoon, everyone thought I was dead, and I spent the whole day walking into rooms to watch faces go white.
314	11	Here's the kicker.
314	12	When I got back to my cubicle my 3-hole-puncher was missing.
314	13	I walked slowly into Barb's cubicle.
314	14	She was mid phone conversation but her jaw dropped and she couldn't speak when she saw me.
314	15	She thought I was dead, and wasted NO time robbing me of my possessions.
314	16	The look on her face when she thought my ghost had returned for his stolen office supplies like some bad Goosebumps novel was worth being dead for a morning.
315	0	I live in an area with fairly low-priced rentals, so it's full of college kids and people who are of lower incomes.
315	1	I was at the corner store and the family in front of me had a case of beer, a 12-pack of Coke, a few packs of cigarettes, chicken nuggets, macaroni and cheese, and some milk.
315	2	Their debit card got denied, so they took out the milk.
315	3	Got denied again, took out the chicken.
315	4	Got denied again, took out the mac'n'cheese.
315	5	Finally got approved, so they were going home with beer, Coke, and cigs.
315	6	Their two kids, maybe 4 and 6, asked what they were having for dinner if they didn't have the chicken nuggets.
315	7	The mom's response was, "You can drink Coke, it's got calories.
315	8	" The younger kid started crying for the chicken nuggets.
315	9	The mom grabbed her by the arm and told her she wasn't getting any dinner.
315	10	I bought their chicken nuggets and ran after them.
315	11	I tried to give them the box, and the mom started screaming at me, "do we look like a fucking charity case, I can raise my own fucking kids, you don't know what it's like being a mom" and tons of other bullshit.
315	12	I was like, "Just take the goddamn chicken, your kids are hungry.
315	13	" The woman hit the box out of my hands and she and her man grabbed the kids and stormed away.
315	14	I wish I'd followed them and called CPS or something.
316	0	I was an avid poster on /r/ladybonersgw with my throwaway account and amongst the PMs someone said that they never thought that they would see someone they knew on that subreddit.
316	1	So obviously I responded with "who dis" and they responded with "oh don't you worry (insert my first name)" I had my suspicions on whom it was but they never responded after that.
316	2	Oh well, most of my friends have seen me naked before.
316	3	Still kept on posting regularly.
317	0	My story:
317	1	When I was 13 a doctor wrote me an adult dose for a certain medicine based on my weight.
317	2	I was a fat kid.
317	3	Our body does not work that way and the medicine ended up constipating me...for a month.
317	4	I did not shit for a whole month.
317	5	I got sick.
317	6	I had racoon-like eyes, my stomach would jump or flutter by itself, I had cramps, etc.
317	7	It was bad.
317	8	I was miserable.
317	9	I finally told my parents how long it had been since i had shit and they freaked out and took me to the hospital.
317	10	There, they gave 3 enemas back to back.
317	11	After the third and final one, all that water softened all that shit up just enough i could expel it.
317	12	I ran to the nearest bathroom, gown open in the back, and tried to make it to the toilet.
317	13	I didn't
317	14	My ass was hovering at a 45 degree angle above the toilet when the geyser burst.
317	15	This next part is not a lie, but i know some of you will think it is, I got shit everywhere.
317	16	On the ceiling (somehow), on the floor, the toilet was covered, the walls, even the sink got hit with some spray.
317	17	Shit was literally, yes literally, sprayed on all walls and ceiling.
317	18	It was everywhere.
317	19	I felt like a new kid after that.
317	20	Cleaned myself up the best i could and then had to figure out what to do.
317	21	There was no way i could clean it all up, I needed a janitor.
317	22	So I walked out and politely told a nurse the bathroom need a clean up and badly.
317	23	A janitor was only a few rooms down for some reason so I saw him go by to clean it, but he did not know who i was, he got to the bathroom and the whole ER heard, "Oh Hell no, I ain't cleaning this up.
317	24	I quit.
317	25	" and he did.
317	26	I felt so bad, still do.
317	27	I made some poor janitor quit his job over a shit-caked bathroom.
318	0	We made a good friend of ours a roommate in a house we were renting, with her two bratty children.
318	1	She was unhappily employed stripping at the time.
318	2	We helped her get good interview clothes, get a good job at Home Depot, get her kids into both head start and therapy(they are both disabled) and helped her buy a house and move out.
318	3	As she left, taking everything not nailed down, she accused me of abusing her children and almost had me beat up.
318	4	Definitely punished for being nice there.
318	5	We lost the house we were renting because of her, and were homeless once again.
318	6	Luckily this was long before my son was born.
319	0	When I was in elementary school (the school had roughly 400 students, about 7-12 years old), our teacher got sick so we got a substitute teacher.
319	1	The problem was that this one was a bitch and everyone hated her.
319	2	She was about 60, wore clothes that a teenager would wear, talked in the phone with her friends all the time during class, and when someone said something against her she would go "I'm older than you kids
319	3	so I know better".
319	4	Just did very annoying and degrading stuff all the time, while not being a very good teacher in general.
319	5	So, probably a few weeks later (can't remember exactly how long) everyone on our class of ~25 people had gotten sick of her bullshit, so we decided to make an address demanding that we get a new substitute teacher because this one was bad.
319	6	Everyone in the class wrote their signature on the paper and we took the paper to the principal.
319	7	The next day we got a new teacher.
319	8	The bitch still stayed in the school, just taught someone else instead.
319	9	Anyway, I thought it was pretty cool for kids that were 10-11 years old to do something like that.
320	0	100% true story.
320	1	Dunno if it'll scare you, but it remains one of the scariest things I've ever experienced.
320	2	When I was 17, I was at a party at a friends house.
320	3	We grew up in a small town, lots of woods, no street lights, houses far apart from one another, etc.
320	4	There was virtually no crime in this town, except for the abduction of a 5th grader about a decade earlier.
320	5	(her remains were found behind a restaurant in the town years later, but the case was never solved)
320	6	My friends and I had been drinking all night, so I didn't want to drive home.
320	7	That happened to me frequently enough that I always had a sleeping bag in the trunk of my car.
320	8	Around 2AM, I ran out to get the sleeping bag.
320	9	It was pouring out with thunder and lightning.
320	10	I could barely see my car, which was parked just beyond the driveway, on the side of the road.
320	11	When I got to it, I popped the trunk, and dug around for my sleeping bag.
320	12	There was a flash of lightning and the street lit up for a second.
320	13	That's when I noticed a middle-aged man standing a few feet from me.
320	14	He didn't move, he just stood completely still.
320	15	I can't remember what I said.
320	16	For all I know, I probably just gasped.
320	17	However, I remember exactly what he said.
320	18	"I just love thunder and lightning storms, don't you?
320	19	"
320	20	Not "Hello" or even "Sorry, didn't mean to startle you.
320	21	"
320	22	I slammed my trunk shut, sleeping bag still in there, and sprinted back to the house.
320	23	I immediately told everyone what happened.
320	24	Of course they were drunk, and they thought I was making it up, but I forced them to look out the window toward the driveway.
320	25	After thirty seconds, lightning struck and the street lit up again.
320	26	Sure enough, there was the man, walking down the street, in the opposite direction from the house.
321	0	After I inadvertently outed myself to my parents via leaving my email open, they became kind of batshit insane.
321	1	But of course, they also called my grandma to tell her the news (since they ended up having me live with her
321	2	so I could switch schools, an idea they seemed to think would rid me of teh gey).
321	3	My grandma came over and had a two hour long lecture with me about how I'm just obviously confused.
321	4	The highlight of the sermon was when this frail, elderly woman told me, "I don't believe you're actually a homosexual.
321	5	If you're telling me you are, and refuse to be wrong, then I will go out in the back yard, get a large stick, shove it up your asshole, and you can tell me how much you enjoy it.
321	6	" Thanks, gramma, but I don't think that's how that works...
322	0	At a truck stop, middle of the night.
322	1	Guy next to me starts talking to me.
322	2	He's 50ish, short, friendly, got a bushy mustache.
322	3	After a moment or two I notice that his mustache is actually his nose hairs which are inches long and obviously combed into the desired mustache shape.
322	4	I was both fascinated and repelled at the same time.
323	0	Of all my delinquent childhood memories, and I do mean delinquent, this one is by far my fondest.
323	1	Get ready for adventure!
323	2	It's the year 2000, and Summer is starting in Phoenix, Arizona.
323	3	It's a long, hot Friday in the butt-hole of the desert, and I'm stuck in High school drama class.
323	4	But, at least it's with my awesome friend, let's call him Sahooshy.
323	5	We're talking about the huge pain in the ass of getting the invincibility cheat in Golden-eye when Sahooshy remembers that he forgot his keys at home!
323	6	He'll be fucked sideways before going home in the ball-roasting heat just to wait for 3 hours for his dad to get home to open the front door!
323	7	Do I just invite him over?
323	8	It crosses my mind.
323	9	But that's just a quick fix to the problem.
323	10	A real solution is to simply stop by my house for my home-made lock pick set, and then BREAK INTO
323	11	HIS HOUSE.
323	12	To this offer, Sahooshy calls bullshit.
323	13	He simply does not believe that I have a home-made lock pick kit, or furthermore, the skills to use it on a deadbolt.
323	14	Challenge accepted.
323	15	While Sahooshy and friends take a dip in the apartment's pool I proceed to work away at picking the lock to his front door.
323	16	They snicker and laugh at the certainty of my failure as I work away.
323	17	*CLICK*
323	18	"Hey Sahooshy!
323	19	I got it!
323	20	" Sahooshy slowly turns his head from the pool.
323	21	"Bullshit!!!
323	22	" he calls.
323	23	Alright, time for some proof.
323	24	"Hey Sahooshy!
323	25	Isn't this your N64
323	26	I'm holding?
323	27	" I wave the system that I just retrieved from inside his house.
323	28	I can hear his jaw hit the water.
323	29	That night, a beautiful scene has been set.
323	30	The gears in our young minds are turning as me, Sahooshy, and Willis watch old horror movies on TV.
323	31	Sahooshy turns to me.
323	32	In his eyes, I see lightning.
323	33	A revelation.
323	34	Sahooshy screams at me, "YOU CAN PICK LOCKS?!?!?
323	35	" "Yeah..." I reply.
323	36	He leaves the couch and returns with a laundry basket half full of dirty clothes.
323	37	"Then we're going to the laundry room right now.
323	38	You're going to pick the lock on the vending machine and we are going to fill this basket full of candy.
323	39	" What could I say?
323	40	This man...
323	41	This man was a **GENIUS**!
323	42	Willis was on look-out duty outside.
323	43	Thankfully, there's not many people around at 1am on a Friday who want to do laundry.
323	44	Near the dryers, Sahooshy pretends to work on a his dirty clothes.
323	45	I can feel the minutes passing as slow as concrete drying.
323	46	My young mind was not used to this kind of stress, this kind of fear, this kind of excitement.
323	47	"What the hell is taking so long?
323	48	" Sahooshy yells.
323	49	"Just give me like 5 more minutes.
323	50	"
323	51	It had only been a month since I downloaded the MIT guide to lock-picking off of a stray FTP site I found while browsing for MP3's.
323	52	"WHY, GOOD EVENING MAM!
323	53	" We hear Willis call from outside.
323	54	Someone's coming!
323	55	I drop my picks and run to Sahooshy's side as a tall young blond comes in with a basket.
323	56	She opens one of the dryers and starts to take out her clothes.
323	57	I tap my fingers on the dryer.
323	58	"WOW.
323	59	SAHOOSHY.
323	60	YOU HAVE A LOT OF CLOTHES..."
323	61	I say.
323	62	Totally believable.
323	63	"YES.
323	64	I SURE DO.
323	65	" He looks at the woman.
323	66	She stares at him a little crooked.
323	67	She takes the rest of her clothes, then leaves.
323	68	We exhale simultaneously.
323	69	I walk back to the vending machine to retrieve my picks from the ground.
323	70	Sahooshy's right behind me.
323	71	He leans against the vending machine.
323	72	"You know, Rmans?
323	73	It's pretty ridiculous what we're doing here.
323	74	" "Yeah..." I reply.
323	75	Sahooshy continues, "I mean, if I really wanted some fucking candy, I would just be like-"
323	76	Playfully, Sahooshy slams his fist into the front of the vending machine.
323	77	*BAM* *CRNCH*
323	78	CRNCH?
323	79	Both our heads slowly turn to the front of the vending machine.
323	80	Time was completely still, the concrete had dried.
323	81	Somehow, Sahooshy had managed to punch clean through the front plastic of the vending machine.
323	82	We look back at each other and knew what we had to do.
323	83	As the door to the laundry room flew open, Willis's eyes darted to the laundry basket that I was barely able to hold above my waist.
323	84	He screams, "Guys!
323	85	You've got to be kidding me!
323	86	What the hell!?
323	87	" I grunt at him quickly, "Just hold on to the clothes at the top so they don't fall off the pile of Doritos!
323	88	" We try to hold back our laughter as we hustle down the pathway back to Sahooshy's place, trying our best to not spill Snickers and BabyRuths along the way.
323	89	We spent the rest of the night watching more horror movies and FEASTING on close to 40 candy bars and countless snack bags of chips that we managed to pull from the hole that Sahooshy had left in the Vending machine.
323	90	To say that it was a glorious night, would be like saying that D-day was just a little bloody.
323	91	That night we feasted as nerd-kings upon the unethical spoils of a long battle of wits, might, and retarded teenage logic.
323	92	It tasted like victory, and by victory, I mean Cool-Ranch Doritos and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.
323	93	The next morning, Sahooshy walked back to the vending machine in the hopes that no one else had completely cleaned it out yet.
323	94	As he opened the laundry room door he's greeted by the smile of a young brunette.
323	95	"Hello" she says.
323	96	"Hey!
323	97	" he replies as he moves *nonchalantly* to the vending machine.
323	98	"Can you believe that vending machine?
323	99	" She asks.
323	100	"...
323	101	Yeah, I know!
323	102	" He responds nodding at the machine nervously.
323	103	"Heh" he laughs.
323	104	She looks at him with a smile, "I mean, who would want candy that badly?
323	105	"
324	0	Back in high school, I went to Wendy's with my (now ex-) girlfriend.
324	1	We had a few extra fries, so, being idiotic high schoolers, we decided we were going to throw them out the window while we were driving.
324	2	We weren't really aiming at anything, but on the way back home, we ended up hitting a car.
324	3	He honked at us and gave us a really angry look.
324	4	We waved apologies and laughed it off.
324	5	We got back to my house and were starting in on some private time, when all the sudden I hear a knock at the door.
324	6	I open it up and, holy shit, it's the cops.
324	7	Apparently, the guy copied down my license plate and called the cops on us.
324	8	He said that the french fry left a huge dent in his car, obviously bullshit.
324	9	Anyway, the cops ask a couple questions, and I stupidly open the screen door for them, and they grab my girlfriend by the arm and start to handcuff her (for throwing a fry).
324	10	My neighbor, who works for the police department as a crossing guard, heads over, and asks the cops what they're doing.
324	11	She repeatedly tells the cops that we're good kids (we are) and asking what kind of authority do they have to arrest her just because some guy said that we had dented his car.
324	12	She eventually did get arrested and had to go to court against this asshole.
325	0	I'll try and keep this as short as possible.
325	1	My ex boyfriend and I dated for a year and a half.
325	2	He seemed normal, had a social life, played hockey, was decent looking - you know, normal.
325	3	He was Jewish, which didn't bother me, but apparently me being a Catholic was an issue.
325	4	He ended up telling me that this was an issue a year and a half into the relationship and that I'd need to convert to Judaism or we wouldn't be able 'progress in our relationship'.
325	5	I was taken aback by this and told him I'd think about it.
325	6	(I knew I wouldn't, but I didn't know what else to say at that moment.
325	7	)
325	8	Shortly after this I discover that he had been cheating on me with women, men, and transsexuals on Craigslist.
325	9	I found all this out while looking through my laptop's browser history for some websites I'd previously had open for school that my ex had closed.
325	10	While searching I came across a random hotmail account that had been logged into a few times over the months.
325	11	I logged in using the only password he had for everything and there it was; m4m, m4t, meet ups dating back months.
325	12	Some of them included price lists.
325	13	He was also prostituting himself.
325	14	I read them all and after a brief burst of OMGWTFs, some tears of disgust and frustration I pulled myself together, turned on my printer, and printed everything out.
325	15	The stack of emails was about 2 inch thick.
325	16	Note: All the emails were time and date stamped for dates that he'd been "studying" at the university library.
325	17	I suppose he failed STATS because he was too busy 'railing bros and hoes' in handicap bathroom stalls.
325	18	Can't explain that one to your parents too easily.
325	19	Anyway, I was expecting him to stop by shortly as he was out playing shinny with my current roommate/squatter.
325	20	So I waited, fuming.
325	21	As soon as they walked through the room I told him, with the most straight face I could possibly hold together, to get to the bedroom.
325	22	I tried to be calm in order to get the answers I wanted.
325	23	I asked him if he was gay.
325	24	No.
325	25	I asked him if he was sure.
325	26	He was sure.
325	27	THEN WTF IS THIS?
325	28	And I threw the papers at him.
325	29	He didn't know what to say except, "Where did you get these?
325	30	" Even though he knew exactly where I got them.
325	31	He had NOTHING to say to me.
325	32	"It would be a shame if your hockey team found out about this one.
325	33	"
325	34	I made him leave after that, but not before packing all his shit in garbage bags.
326	0	I work a gift shop in a hospital.
326	1	One day, this sweet old lady came in and started looking around.
326	2	She came up to the counter with a small flashlight and an umbrella.
326	3	I told her the price, $13, and saw that her wallet was nearly empty.
326	4	She asked if we took checks.
326	5	Trying to do something nice, I said yes and tossed the check as soon as she left and opened the register to put my own money in.
326	6	My boss then walks in and sees me with the register open, money in my hand, and no customer.
326	7	She bitches at me for stealing money and throws in a "You can never trust a foreigner with money" (I'm Pakistani, btw).
326	8	She said I had an hour to pack up my stuff and leave and went back into her office.
326	9	I walked out of there with my dignity and 3 stolen packs of gum and a magazine.
327	0	I had the exact same thing happen to me!
327	1	I was supporting a party with a company I work for and everyone had cleared out.
327	2	The DJ let me know that somebody had left their purse behind.
327	3	I went inside the purse and used the phone to call her friends...telling her friends that I had the girls purse and where my house was.
327	4	30 minutes later she comes in storming in drunk accusing me of stealing her purse.
327	5	I told her why the hell would I have her come to my house if I had stolen it.
327	6	Her friends that were with her were embarrassed for her and she kept yelling at me.
327	7	I called her a cunt, threw her purse at her, slammed the door, and told her to get the fuck out of my house.
327	8	She apologized profusely the next day.
328	0	I moved closer to work about a year ago.
328	1	I live in a large apartment complex with the local police force being very attentive to this area because of past issues.
328	2	I'm a female in my late twenties.
328	3	I live alone in a building with multiple families because they all have 2 bedroom apartments.
328	4	I chose mine because I wanted a bedroom and an office.
328	5	People appearantly notice this kind of thing.
328	6	I have two doors to enter.
328	7	One for my entryway and one from my balcony which is difficult to get to outside unless you scale my 5 foot storage area.
328	8	I sleep in my living room for stupid reasons and was awakened by my balcony door being opened one night last december.
328	9	A man had entered into my home of a month and l met his gaze with an equally terrified face.
328	10	He apologized to me and told me he had no ill intentions.
328	11	He was scared
328	12	and all he wanted was help.
328	13	He just had nowhere else to go and work a lot so it seemed like no one was living in my apt.
328	14	He had a job close by but no home.
328	15	He'd been staying in my apartment when I was not there (he never took or ate anything).
328	16	I googled him and found nothing.
328	17	He just desperately needed help.
328	18	So I let him live here for 4 months rent free and he is now employed and living in an apartment across the street.
329	0	Some buddies and I attended the high school graduation of a friend a year after we had graduated.
329	1	After one of the names was called, a great amount of whooping and hooting was heard from a few rows behind us.
329	2	I leaned over to my friend and said, "They sound like a bunch of monkeys!
329	3	" Of course the family causing the ruckus turned out to be black.
329	4	:(
330	0	I think Ive told this story on reddit before.
330	1	When I was young my grandma came over to our house to babysit me one night.
330	2	Nothing unusual happened the whole night.
330	3	But when my mom got home she checked the answering machine, and there was a message a few minutes long.
330	4	The message was just my grandmother's and my voice laughing hysterically for the whole message.
330	5	Like I said the night was normal, and there wasnt a moment when the phone rang, or laughed hysterically for minutes on end.
331	0	Not a truck driver but my dads a transport manager (Tells the truckers where to go basically)
331	1	and he's told me quite a few good ones.
331	2	One time a lorry was supposed to be delivering a large amount of alcohol to a store in the middle of the Welsh valleys.
331	3	Apparently it hit a roundabout too harshly and toppled everywhere.
331	4	By the time the police arrived the locals had already come and gone with all the alcohol from the back of the truck.
331	5	It took them less than 10 minutes.
331	6	Another one was when Cardiff was creating the Millennium Stadium.
331	7	Apparently there were 3 lorries driving down the M4, each one carrying artificial grass for the stadium.
331	8	The motorway was shut though as there was a potential jumper on one of the bridges overhead.
331	9	Now this was on a Friday afternoon so needless to say all the drivers were pretty pissed off that they couldn't get home on time.
331	10	Apparently it took 3 policemen to try and talk to guy off the ledge, and 20 police to hold back all the truckers who wanted to push him already.
331	11	I probably know a few more that I can't quite think of right now, but I'll update this later if they come to me.
332	0	PCP is an ongoing problem in my city.
332	1	It turns people into the incredible hulk in which nothing works in taking them down, more or less.
332	2	One time there was a naked man in the middle of our bussiest street with a broadsword.
332	3	We literally had to circle him, and shoot him with pepper spray, rubber bullets, beanbag bullets and taser him at the same time to get him to drop the weapon.
332	4	On average it takes 6 officers to arrest one man on pcp if the man is angry.
332	5	This guy took about 10 police officers working together to arrest him.
332	6	I sat in my squad car and sipped coffee as i've had many incounters with pcp users and have my own battlescars.
333	0	When I was 4 or 5 I really, really wanted a cobra.
333	1	I was really into Egyptian stuff and animals, and obviously a cobra fulfilled both of those interests.
333	2	My mom also made me go to Sunday school with some of the dumbest fucking adults I've yet to meet.
333	3	I'm talking people who not only believed that humans lived at the same time as dinosaurs, but that they communicated with them through dance and song.
333	4	Anyways, since I obviously couldn't acquire a cobra through the normal means, I drew one on a piece of paper and started carrying it around.
333	5	I don't know if you've ever seen a five year old's drawings but they're not what you'd call art.
333	6	This 'cobra' basically looked like a koala that'd been repeatedly run over, dyed yellow and made to walk around smiling real big.
333	7	I took it everywhere, though, and was convinced that everyone was convinced by and terrified of my (drawing of a) cobra.
333	8	So one day I'm just hanging about in Sunday school with my cobra, throwing blocks at the floor or whatever it is five year olds do.
333	9	My teacher strolls over to say something about Jesus and sees me and the cobra just chilling, and her eyes get really big.
333	10	'Is that a.. a cobra?
333	11	'
333	12	Obviously I said yes and grinned really big.
333	13	'You should.. take that outside.
333	14	*Now.
333	15	*'
333	16	She started breathing really hard.
333	17	I being the little shithead I was picked it up and got it really close to her face, at which point she started whimpering and backing away really fast, asking how this was legal to have a cobra with you in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
333	18	I got to go home early.
333	19	My dog eventually ate the cobra.
334	0	One time when I was in the 6th grade I was at a swimming camp with some of my friends.
334	1	There had been this girl there who I had been hitting it off with.
334	2	I thought, "Hey, she might be my first girlfriend.
334	3	Don't fuck this up!
334	4	" It spread around the camp that she liked me and I liked her.
334	5	On the last day of camp, there was party.
334	6	At the party we were all in our street clothes and she's wearing this nice off white skirt.
334	7	She approaches me and asks me to get her a blue-raspberry snow cone and then and only then could I be her boyfriend.
334	8	Of course I oblige and get the snow cone and as I am walking in her direction with snow cone in hand I see a huge smile blooming on her face.
334	9	I was ecstatic that I was finally going to have a girlfriend.
334	10	Just a few away from her my mind decides to shut down and I threw the snow cone at her.
334	11	It wasn't a hard, overhand throw but more of a soft underhand toss.
334	12	I don't know why I did this.
334	13	The regret instantly dawns over me while I watch this delicious blue dyed snow cone hurls in her direction.
334	14	"SPLAT.
334	15	" Blue snow cone all over this girls white skirt.
334	16	Needless to say we were not boyfriend and girlfriend after this.
335	0	I was coming down the stairs into the subway.
335	1	A homeless woman was struggling to get down the stairs.
335	2	She was carrying about six suitcases of various size - but all large.
335	3	As I moved past her, she dropped two of them down the stairs, and I - not thinking about anything but trying to be helpful - raced down the stairs to grab them before they tumbled all the way down.
335	4	I gathered the bags up, and as I stood up to hand the woman her bags, with a big stupid grin on my face - i get a open-handed slap.
335	5	Right in the fuckin' kisser.
335	6	I stood there, stunned.
335	7	She was about 3 steps up from me, so the slap was downward, and knocked me clear across the face.
335	8	She started to scream at me for "touching her" and how i should get the fuck away.
335	9	I stuttered, trying to make sense of the situation.
335	10	I said something like "But I... you..." and she just screamed that if I didn't like getting slapped I should just go talk to the cops.
335	11	I turn, and there's a fucking cop - JUST STANDING THERE.
335	12	Asshole saw the whole thing, and just stared at me like he had a fucking digestion problem.
335	13	At that point, I dropped the bags and walked away.
335	14	Worst part - this is rush hour, TONS of people in the subway.
335	15	Not a single person stopped to check out what was going on.
335	16	Not a damn one.
335	17	Fuck New York City.
336	0	A little after graduating High School, my ex-gf was killed in a car crash.
336	1	I was super torn up about it because I had a lot of feelings for her still even though she had gotten a new bf.
336	2	I posted a picture of her from a throwaway with the story of us and what happened to her in /r/pics.
336	3	I didn't expect it to attract any attention, I guess I just wanted a way to anonymously talk to anyone who was listening about how much she meant to me and how badly I'll miss her.
336	4	I woke up the next day to the post on the front page and (for some reason) links to the post all over Facebook.
336	5	People I never had met or heard of were sharing the story and her picture all over social media, talking about me as if I was her true love.
336	6	It made me feel shitty because I wasn't trying to portray it that way out of respect for her poor current bf.
336	7	My Mom eventually saw the post online and linked it to me, saying she knew I had written it because she recognized how I talk.
336	8	Eventually everyone figured out it was me and I had a lot of people come up to me and talk about it at her memorial.
336	9	It felt very surreal.
337	0	I once found a mobile phone on the floor on my way to college, and of course as any normal person would i took it, later that day i checked how much it would be worth if i sold it to one of those recycling websites like envirophone, which claimed i could get 50.
337	1	I then checked the phone to see if i knew who it belonged to, from pictures etc, turns out it was a kid who lived nearish to me who i didn't know very well.
337	2	Although i did know he was the kind of person that if he had found my phone would have sold it in a heartbeat, i played about with my two options for a while then decided that i would do the right thing in the hopes that someone would do me the same courtesy if i ever lost my phone i returned it to the house.
337	3	The kid didn't thank me and still hasn't thanked me to this day, just took the phone on the door step and said something along the lines of 'i thought i had lost this'.
337	4	I then lost my wallet (containing ID) a few days later and never got it back, so much for damn karma.
338	0	This story (story within a story) was told to me by a friend Mark:
338	1	During high school Mark was over at his friend's house, we'll just call him Steve b/c I don't know his name.
338	2	They were hanging out in Steve's room after just hanging up a poster of Limp Bizkit's "Significant Other" album cover that Steve had just bought.
338	3	Minutes later Steve's dad comes by and orders him to take the poster down immediately.
338	4	When he asked his dad why, he says never mind why and to just listen to him and do it.
338	5	Steve is pissed but listens to his dad and takes it down.
338	6	Later Steve asked his dad why he told him to take down the poster.
338	7	This is the story he told him:
338	8	When I was young, your aunt, uncles and I had to all sleep on the floor in one room because we were very poor.
338	9	One night someone walked into the room, bent over my head and asked me, "Give me your soul.
338	10	" I was so afraid I'd pretend to be asleep.
338	11	This thing would ask me to give him my soul a few times then get up and walk out of the room.
338	12	This happened every other night until I reached my early teens.
338	13	One night after he was walking away I opened my eyes to see his face.
338	14	What I saw was a thing with the body of a human, he wore a hood and underneath the hood was a face of a lizard.
338	15	A few years before you were born we threw a Halloween party at our house with all of our family.
338	16	We ran out of candy so I drove to the local market to pick some more up.
338	17	On the way there I was listening to the radio and they said to call in with your scariest story.
338	18	I pulled over to the side of the road, called them on a pay phone and told the story of this lizard man over the air.
338	19	When I got back home I could hear someone crying.
338	20	I went upstairs into the bedroom and saw my sister crying on the bed.
338	21	I asked her what was wrong.
338	22	She said, **"I heard you on the radio.
338	23	That happened to me too.
338	24	"**
339	0	My ma and I saw a woman leave the parking lot with her purse on her car, we followed her and honked at her to get her attention.
339	1	She sped off and her purse went flying so we did the obvious thing parked to the side and had me risk my life to get this woman's belongings.
339	2	After dodging traffic to pick up her damaged purse with wallet and cell phone we headed to address listed on the license/ID and gave her belongings to her brother and his wife.
339	3	They thanked us and gave us a bag of tea.
339	4	We thought that was the end of that, but they invited us to pray with them a month later.
339	5	They gave us a bible, a white dress and things got weird when this preacher man came to say the end of the world was coming!
339	6	That the end was coming if the middle east ever got its problems sorted out that it meant Jesus was coming!!!
339	7	We said we had to leave because I had school in the morning...so I didn't get accused of anything, but things still managed to get weird.
340	0	I woke up one morning and I had to take what potentially was the worst shit of my life.
340	1	I'm talking last night's beer, chili cheese fries with jalapenos, and biscuits and gravy.
340	2	I was clenching, feeling this terribly bubbling in my stomach.
340	3	I did not even think I could make it to the bathroom.
340	4	When I get to the bathroom, my roommate is inside taking a shower.
340	5	She takes LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG showers.
340	6	Bitch takes an hour or an hour and a half.
340	7	It's ridiculous.
340	8	I knock on the door.
340	9	She answers that she'll be done soon.
340	10	But after waiting 15 minutes I realize it just won't do.
340	11	This is a good time to interject that I was also on my period during the 'heavy' part.
340	12	So I run to my room panicked.
340	13	I look around and final I crouch over my cats' litter box and unleash this monster.
340	14	It not only is liquidy, massive, and painful but I proceed to ALSO fall into the litterbox once I am done.
340	15	Now I am naked, bleeding, covered in both my cats' and my shit and litter.
340	16	It was so difficult to clean up.
340	17	TL:DR Attempted to poop in litterbox, failed and fell in.
341	0	In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house in you can get yourself to.
341	1	When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself "The Holder of the End".
341	2	Should a look of child-like fear come over the workers face, you will then be taken to a cell in the building.
341	3	It will be in a deep hidden section of the building.
341	4	All you will hear is the sound of someone talking to themselves echo the halls.
341	5	It is in a language that you will not understand, but your very soul will feel unspeakable fear.
341	6	Should the talking stop at any time, STOP and QUICKLY say aloud "I'm just passing through, I wish to talk.
341	7	" If you still hear silence, flee.
341	8	Leave, do not stop for anything, do not go home, don't stay at an inn, just keep moving, sleep where your body drops.
341	9	You will know in the morning if you've escaped.
341	10	If the voice in the hall comes back after you utter those words continue on.
341	11	Upon reaching the cell all you will see is a windowless room with a person in the corner, speaking an unknown language, and cradling something.
341	12	The person will only respond to one question.
341	13	"What happens when they all come together?
341	14	"
341	15	The person will then stare into your eyes and answer your question in horrifying detail.
341	16	Many go mad in that very cell, some disappear soon after the meeting, a few end their lives.
341	17	But most do the worst thing, and look upon the object in the person's hands.
341	18	You will want to as well.
341	19	Be warned that if you do, your death will be one of cruelty and unrelenting horror.
341	20	Your death will be in that room, by that person's hands.
341	21	That object is 1 of 2538.
341	22	They must never come together.
341	23	Never.
341	24	[more objects here](http://theholders.org/)
342	0	Late to the party here, but lifeguards of reddit will get me on this one.
342	1	I managed a pool for ten years.
342	2	It had a "zero-depth" area, where the water gets gradually deeper, like a beach.
342	3	This was also the area with all the kiddie toys.
342	4	Parents would send their toddlers out there on their own, while they chatted, read, sunbathed, etc.
342	5	The thing was like a succubus for toddlers and three or four of them would go under daily, resulting in my guards or me going in and saving the lives of these children, lest they see Davy Jones' Locker.
342	6	The parents basically thought we were babysitters and didn't give a damn about their children while they were swimming.
342	7	At least once a week, I would have to deal with some parent flipping out about how their kid was fine and we had no right to touch them.
342	8	Threats were made about cops and lawyers.
342	9	Luckily we always had a patrolman on duty at our pool.
342	10	He would laugh in their faces and threaten to arrest them for neglect, which usually shut them up.
342	11	Once, one of my 98 pound female lifeguards saved two kids at the same time.
342	12	Her reward, a smack across the face from an irate mother.
342	13	I've never seen a cop react so fast.
342	14	I miss that job.
343	0	My first real Reddit post was to AskReddit, asking what people would do if they found out they had a sibling that had been adopted years before.
343	1	Mostly because I recently discovered that is the boat I am in, and I thought it would be interesting to hear what other people would do if they found that out, or hear from people who might have been through it.
343	2	Not one response.
343	3	Not one.
343	4	Crickets.
343	5	I was nearly hyperventilating because it was such a personal thing and hard to put out there, and I was worrying people would be rough and......
343	6	I obviously didn't need to worry.
343	7	I figure I'll do another post about it someday, but...eh
344	0	I was 16 and getting on the last bus of the night to go home.
344	1	It was about 10:30.
344	2	A man got on the bus a couple stops after I had.
344	3	He was 25 cents short and the bus driver was trying to tell him that he couldn't get on without it, but he didn't speak any English.
344	4	I casually got out of my seat, and put a quarter into fare box for him.
344	5	It really wasn't a big deal.
344	6	My house was sort of in the boonies.
344	7	No street lights and the houses were pretty spread out, but it was only a quarter mile from my house to the bus stop.
344	8	I get off on my stop and notice that this man had gotten off with me.
344	9	I immediately knew something was wrong because no one else ever gets off the bus out there.
344	10	I had time to lay one solid pound on the side of the bus while it was pulling away to try to stop the driver, but it didn't work.
344	11	I didn't make eye contact.
344	12	I walked as quickly as I could, and so did he.
344	13	Then he started running.
344	14	I wasn't sure if I would make it to my house and didn't know if I wanted him knowing where I lived even if I could.
344	15	I ran to the one house in between mine and the bus stop.
344	16	It was a fucking humongous house.
344	17	I had never met the people that lived there, but I didn't care.
344	18	As I was about halfway up the driveway I couldn't hear him behind me anymore.
344	19	Two giant people answered the door.
344	20	I was shaking, and looking down the driveway, and trying to explain what happened.
344	21	I just wanted to use the phone to call my folks.
344	22	Then I realize that I'm speaking to two giant teenagers, they tell me to wait and they would get their dad.
344	23	Turns out dad was a bald, 7ft, 350lb badass who fucking hates immigrants.
344	24	I asked if I could use the phone and he said he would just drive me home.
344	25	We go get in his gigantic pickup truck.
344	26	I told him which way I lived, and which way I thought the guy went.
344	27	Giant redneck dad decides to find this dude first.
344	28	He pulled up behind him, turned his brights on, and screamed profanities while acting like he was going to run him over.
344	29	Neighbor took me home.
344	30	I never called the cops.
344	31	I started carrying a knife.
345	0	Will begin from the beginning:
345	1	At a young age, probably 6,7 I was exposed to sex very early in terms of incest (an Ask reddit thread is never complete without an incest post.
345	2	:D).
345	3	So when I was 8 things stopped incest wise, but I was still curious at 10 so when my mom's friend came over with her son I tried stuff on the son, we played a game, if I catched him I would play with his penis, I caught him many times.
345	4	At 14 I became friends with my neighbor and I kind of got with his 10 year old sister, fingered her, she fingered herself in front of me.
345	5	I've told one person about this and he called me a pedo I said I was young and didn't know what I was thinking, but I think that's a lie.
345	6	At 18 I planned to kill my father and this dick at school who the majority hated.
345	7	Plan for my father was poisoning, I decided that poisoning wasn't the way to go and he needed to suffer, so I put a pin in it.
345	8	With the other guy I planned on killing him by slitting his throat late at the end of the day at school, since there would hardly be anyone around.
345	9	So around 4 he was walking to the locker room i was following him, he entered and i entered and I immediately grabbed his head and smashed it against the wall, he was still awake but disoriented, I took out a knife ready to slit his throat
345	10	but then I heard people walking and talking, I got scared and blitzed out of there.
345	11	He never saw who did it luckily.
345	12	I am better now, haven't seen that guy in months and I am over my dad.
346	0	It's been awhile so it's unlikely anyone would read this except for OP, but what the hell.
346	1	I was in Taiwan one year when I was younger, and had travelled to a busy night market (these are popular gatherings that usually operate in the evening).
346	2	Nearby I spotted a sign for a netcafe in a 5-6 story tall building.
346	3	Thinking I'd fire off some quick emails, I walked in the dark, small entrance of the building.
346	4	The building was older and hasn't been well maintained, but it's not out of the ordinary in Taiwan.
346	5	The entrance just had a dark hallway that led to a small elevator.
346	6	I pressed the elevator call button and entered.
346	7	The elevator was uncharacteristically new compared to the building, but I didn't think much of it.
346	8	Like some Chinese buildings, there wasn't a fourth floor (it's considered bad luck since "four" sounds like "death"), so it just read 1-2-3-5-6, which was usual.
346	9	I looked for the floor the netcafe was at-- 6th floor, and pressed the button.
346	10	It lurched into action quietly and began the ascend.
346	11	When it stopped, I figured it was my floor
346	12	so I instinctively began to step out.
346	13	Right before stepping out, however, the sight outside the elevator stopped me.
346	14	It was pitch dark, only lit by the light in the elevator, it looked like it hasn't been occupied for decades, with some random pieces of furniture covered with white cloth or similar.
346	15	It was a small building, so each floor were single occupancy, so I could see pretty much the entire floor from the elevator.
346	16	Thinking I must have gotten the wrong floor, I checked the light (that indicates which floor you're on).
346	17	Strangely, there was nothing, none of the indicators were on, but the floor button to the netcafe was still lit
346	18	so I know I haven't gotten there yet.
346	19	All this happened within a couple of seconds.
346	20	That's when I noticed a figure moving in the distance of the floor-- it was not very visible but I could make out what looks like a person dressed in some kind of gown, moving slowly towards the elevator.
346	21	I was *thoroughly* creeped out, so I started pressing the close door button.
346	22	As soon as I pressed it, the elevator light flickered off.
346	23	I am *this* close to pissing my pants, and it's actually kind of freaking me out thinking back to it.
346	24	The lights flickered back on under a second and the door closed, the elevator jolted back to life.
346	25	A few moments later it opened again to the netcafe.
346	26	I am beyond relieved at this point.
346	27	I walked out immediately and sat down at a computer.
346	28	After gathering my wits a bit, I walked over to the cashier's desk and told them what I saw.
346	29	The girl working there listened and her face turned a bit ashen, so I asked her if she heard of similar.
346	30	She told me that she's never experienced it, but some coworkers and occasional customers have brought it up-- basically, the building has 6 floors, and the fourth floor had a history.
346	31	Apparently the floor used to be a hair salon of sorts, until one of the employees killed herself there for some reason.
346	32	She slit her wrists over the hair wash station and died.
346	33	The store continued operations despite stories of weird appearances-- when customers got their hair rinsed the water would look a little red, like the customer was bleeding, little things like that, and a couple people reported seeing someone's figure walking away in the mirror.
346	34	Naturally, the business closed down a few months later.
346	35	The building owner tried to re-rent the place out, but never had any luck.
346	36	Most businesses are quite superstitious, and no one wanted to rent the fourth floor after someone had died in it, even at a very cheap price.
346	37	Finally, after dropping the price to nearly nothing, a stationary supplies store wanted to rent.
346	38	During the renovations of the floor, however, several accidents would happen.
346	39	Tools would end up in strange places, a mirror from the previous business shattered when no one was near it, and finally a worker had his hand jammed between the elevator doors when it closed on him unexpectedly.
346	40	The workers refused to continue working and finally, the business left and the building owner finally gave up and shut down the floor.
346	41	He then had the elevator company come in to replace the panel so that the elevator could not go to the fourth floor.
346	42	Let me repeat that-- the elevator was programmed to *never* go to the fourth floor.
346	43	It doesn't even have a button.
346	44	But for some reason, sometimes when people take the elevator, it would go to the fourth floor and the doors would open, and some, like myself, would see a figure walking around in the dark.
347	0	One time I was asleep in a friends garage after a party.
347	1	I had drank way too much and passed out on the dogs bed.
347	2	I felt awful, as the next day I realized the dog was out in the cold.
347	3	Anyway, I woke up about 4 am and everyone around me in the garage was passed out, it was dark, and I was disoriented.
347	4	I stood up and had to piss.
347	5	I tried to find my way to the door but fell over, gave up, stood up and pissed right there.
347	6	The next day I wake up again, and clearly see the piss on the floor next to the table.
347	7	At this point I was the only one in the room with my friends dad, who was the owner of the house.
347	8	He was always cool with us drinking, and was just cleaning up.
347	9	I saw him wiping down the table, with what looked like one single paper towel.
347	10	He then smiled at me and asked me if I felt horrible.
347	11	I couldn't say anything, and just stared as he wiped up my urine with that single paper towel.
347	12	I know he had it all over his hands.
347	13	It was funny, it was horrifying.
348	0	At my previous job I worked with a "story topper".
348	1	You know, she did it way better, cooler, and sooner than everyone else.
348	2	She even started using my stories.
348	3	I was very irritated.
348	4	I started taking a pen or two a week from her desk.
348	5	Sometimes it was some little doo-dad.
348	6	I would casually snatch an item then take it to the mens bathroom where I would put it into a hole near the sink pipes.
348	7	It sounds stupid, but it made me feel like a bad ass.
348	8	I wish I could be there when they have to repair that sink and find all of her supplies in that wall.
349	0	So all three of my frenulums (I'm male) have had weird stuff happen.
349	1	When I was about 13, I split the one under my top lip.
349	2	I was playing on a trampoline with my mates, a game called "Crack the Egg", where one person goes into fetal position as tight as they can while the other bounce around them until the fetus has to unfurl because they get scared or whatever.
349	3	So I was the egg, and and somehow I bounced and my right knee hit me in the mouth.
349	4	I though I was fine
349	5	but I was bleeding a little bit.
349	6	I thought it was my nose
349	7	but I had actually split the frenulum under my top lip.
349	8	It stung for like a couple hours and then it was fine.
349	9	Now it's like there are two sections of it, one of them is a little flap on the top lip.
349	10	PROOF:

349	12	A couple years later, I had to have a collection of fluid drained from just next to the other frenulum in my mouth (the one under the tongue).
349	13	I guess it's not exactly my frenulum, but oh well.
349	14	And finally, I have frenulum breve, aka a short penis frenulum.
349	15	It's not too extreme
349	16	but it's definitely short, as in I can't pull my foreskin flat along the shaft when erect.

350	0	At 12 years of age my mom let me stay in the truck as she went grocery shopping.
350	1	As I wait I see an old Guy walking towards the truck with an indescribable look at me as if I know too much.
350	2	he stops 5 feet from the truck looks at me for a coupple seconds and heads back the exact way he came.
350	3	it was rather traumatic for some reason andvery confusing at that age.
350	4	5-6 years later my dad was showing me home videos of us at Yellowstone.
350	5	at old faithful I noticed the same Guy,same look, same clothes peering at us on camera and at me through the TV.
350	6	I'm freaked out just telling this.
351	0	yep.. same thing happened to me.
351	1	many times in fact!
351	2	the first one: catherine, well we were like BFFs because every weekend i would go to my dads (he lived about 1/2 hour away on a military base) and she was the only person i knew.
351	3	we had SO much fun!
351	4	then in grade 6 or 7 the cooler kids asked her to hang out, but refused to let me join.
351	5	THEN this new kid shows up, sam, she was super skinny and everyone teased her for being anorexic... in grade 6 no less...
351	6	anyway as it turns out (she told me) she was talking online all the time and saying how she was going to off herself.
351	7	i never knew, she never talked to me about it
351	8	but she said it was just get attention, she started talking to everyone about how she just wanted to die and then she would laugh about it...
351	9	i was like WTF?
351	10	anyway the guidance councellor at the school talked the cool kids into befriending her because they were scared she was serious.
351	11	well no.
351	12	SHE wasn't.
351	13	after that happened she started to hate me.
351	14	years later i was hospitalized for an over dose and treated for slitting my wrists.
351	15	(bleh w/e im done with that shit now...
351	16	i was stupid)
351	17	ANYWAY, this happened a few more times with different people and i never knew what it was about me that they didn't like.
351	18	i often wondered if they were spreading rumors about me because of how many times i lost my best friend.
351	19	oddly enough, this is the first time i've ever told anyone.
351	20	dont you feel special reddit?
352	0	Found a iPhone 4s, (the newest available model) sitting in some sand on the side of a road walking my dog near the [Cleveland Dam](http://www.greatervancouverparks.com/ClevelandDam01.html).
352	1	It was locked so I couldn't call the owner, but I picked it up figuring the owner would call later and I'd return it.
352	2	After about an hour the owner calls and I explain exactly where I found it, he calls me a liar and a thief.
352	3	Me: "You dumb motherfucker.
352	4	I'm going to give you one chance.
352	5	Answer all five of these questions correctly or you never see your phone again.
352	6	"
352	7	Him: "OK."
352	8	Me: "What is the 8th planet from the sun?
352	9	"
352	10	Him: "**FUCK!!!!
352	11	YOU!!!!!
352	12	**"
352	13	I threw the phone over the dam.
352	14	It shattered into a million pieces on the rocks below.
353	0	So, I'm at a thrift shop, when this adorable little 4 year old girl comes running up from the children's section to her dad on the next row.
353	1	She's all excited and says, "Dad, do you like this shirt?
353	2	"
353	3	He's a total dick and snaps,"No, go away.
353	4	" Now, this catches my attention.
353	5	The little girl is undeterred.
353	6	She says, "Mommy wanted me to see if you like this shirt.
353	7	Do you?
353	8	"
353	9	He replies, "No, I don't.
353	10	"
353	11	"Are you sure you don't?
353	12	Because mommy wanted me to check with you.
353	13	"
353	14	"No.
353	15	Is the reason you like it because it has Justin Bieber on it?
353	16	"
353	17	"No, I just like it and want to get it?
353	18	"
353	19	"No, you can't.
353	20	"
353	21	"But I like it.
353	22	"
353	23	"Whatever, get it if you want, just go away.
353	24	"
353	25	So, the little girl goes running back to her mom, and you can hear her say, "Mommy, daddy says he liked it!
353	26	"
353	27	The guy sighs and grumbles to himself, "I did not say that.
353	28	" He realizes that there's a lady standing near him who heard the whole thing and that he seemed to be pretty jerkish.
353	29	So he looks at her and says, "Sorry, that's my wife's idea of a joke.
353	30	See, my name's Justin Bieber.
353	31	"
353	32	Just a random moment in time, but I can't help but feel for the guy.
353	33	For most of his life, he's just a normal guy with a normal name, and then one day, some jackass sees a Canadian kid's YouTube video and now every time this guy tells someone his name, he has to get shit for it.
353	34	Bummer.
354	0	I had a work colleague who was brought in by management on a large scale project and was effectively given the green light to do whatever she wanted.
354	1	This chick got drunk off the small bit of authority she had and made people's lives a misery.
354	2	She absolutely hated my boss and was trying every trick in the book to make his life a misery.
354	3	My job would take too long to explain but I was effectively a go to guy for quite a few aspects in the office
354	4	so I knew I was safe.
354	5	but she was trying to get him to quit or get me to leave his team.
354	6	What she didn't know was my partner had moved home to Oz
354	7	and I had kept it a secret that I was going to follow after a few months.
354	8	Life was ticking by but this fucking she beast pig dog was driving me up the wall.
354	9	My hours were being increased the work load was phenomenal.
354	10	I asked her to get some one else in for me to train as I needed time off from time to time and always refused in the most passively aggressive way imaginable.
354	11	Anyway the date had been set and projects were coming to a head which would have seen my work load increase to new levels (I was pulling 14 hour days already).
354	12	I went up to my head boss and informed him of my decision and the reasons.
354	13	He offered to get me a visa for my partner and her old job back if I stayed (helped my ego as I was wondering was I shit at what I did as I was getting so much shit from this woman).
354	14	I refused saying I'd need to leave in a month and needed two weeks off.
354	15	He wished me well and understood my reasons.
354	16	All my references were sorted everything wrapped up.
354	17	The beauty of this was my other managers who were involved in the project hated this bitch as well so I told them of my plan.
354	18	They were all happy to play along and play dumb.
354	19	A big meeting was taking place later that day and off she goes delegating like a champ to everyone bossing them all pushing people's buttons.
354	20	Then it came to my turn, I made a point of asking her was there any scope to get some one in to help as I'm slammed as it is.
354	21	Usual dull tone response of go fuck yourself basically.
354	22	ok, no problem.
354	23	She starts to outline everything that's going and all the shit I'll have to do.
354	24	The expectations were crazy and her last sentence was.
354	25	"so you'll have to all that".
354	26	No, I don't think I will.
354	27	Her face twisted and she snarled at me.
354	28	What do you mean you won't do it?
354	29	Like I said.
354	30	I don't want to do it so I won't.
354	31	In fact I quit.
354	32	I'm moving to Australia in four weeks and I'm taking two weeks holidays before I go.
354	33	So fuck you.
354	34	Her face dropped, she was lost for words.
354	35	She was scrambling saying I'd have to train someone.
354	36	I took out a copy of my contract and said my responsibilities were clearly defined and I would honour those ones.
354	37	As she hadn't updated my contract and responsibilities I wasn't obliged to help her.
354	38	I also showed her the copy of the e mail I had just sent to HR showing her responses to my objections of the hours I was working and her refusal to train anyone else.
354	39	My bosses at the table were loosing their shit trying not to laugh in her face.
354	40	Walked out with one manager getting up to pat my back.
354	41	Possibly told her to get fucked once or twice more and this is what she had coming to her.
354	42	All of her projects got fucked over so other managers were able to crucify her.
354	43	She also got hauled up for the over working and refusing help.
354	44	And the best part is when the head honcho heard he came down to actually say well played on telling her to get fucked (he had no idea what had been going on) and she walked by and heard him saying it to me.
354	45	The whole office knew what I did and everyone was delighted some one fucked her over.
354	46	I went back to visit at Christmas and people still came up and said how happy they were I did it.
355	0	Writing this as the witness of the punishers
355	1	So my boyfriend and I just graduated, and were, naturally, receiving some cards in the mail.
355	2	Some with money, some without, whatever.
355	3	Anyways, my boyfriend has this grandpa who inherited a lot of money way back when and has since "invested" (lost) most of it in the stock market.
355	4	The family always rants about how he doesn't give a shit about them, and tries to milk him for money (he bought their two cars before he lost a lot of his money).
355	5	My boyfriend received a card from him with no money in it, laughed at the snarky message ("money is fleeting, knowledge is power"), and seemed happy enough.
355	6	A few days later, his mom is making a list of everyone who sent him cards.
355	7	She even writes down how much each person sent, as if that would determine the extent of her thank-you, and compares the amounts.
355	8	When the grandpa comes up and she remembers he didn't send any money, she doesn't write his name down.
355	9	Apparently she planned to only send thank-you's to the people who sent cash.
355	10	She and her husband then proceeded to bitterly remark, with the biggest eye-rolls possible, that, since the grandpa had decided to help pay for my boyfriend's college education, they GUESSED that made up for it.
355	11	As someone who hasn't seen or heard from my grandparents and the majority of my extended family since I was 5 due to family pettiness, I was pissed
356	0	Got halfway trough the thread before I remembered I had one.
356	1	I had a buddy all through high school.
356	2	He wasnt very bright but he was a good kid.
356	3	He tried to enlist several times but his eyes held him back, even after laser surgery.
356	4	We had good times in school together.
356	5	Afterwards, I went to college about an hour away and he started working.
356	6	We would occasionally see each other from then on.
356	7	We went to casinos and hung out a few times a year and again times were good.
356	8	Now fast forward a about 4 years and all of a sudden he is engaged and about to be married.
356	9	I get a call on a Wednesday which asks if I'm ready to go.
356	10	"Go where?
356	11	" I reply.
356	12	But of course, to his wedding on Saturday!
356	13	I was a backup groomsmen and no one had told me.
356	14	I drop everything I was doing and zip on down to his town.
356	15	Along the way I call him, congratulating and getting ready to party.
356	16	I ask about clothing and he says I can wear what ever I like as the wedding is very casual.
356	17	I decide to wear my military uniform as it is dressy and it makes me feel fancy.
356	18	No go says the bride.
356	19	Her parents were vehemently anti-military.
356	20	Alright, no problem, I'll wear a nice 2 button suit.
356	21	Grey with soft pinstripes, a white shirt with a pink and brown tie (my tie, her colors)
356	22	No go, says the bride.
356	23	Not dressy enough for my casual wedding.
356	24	Ok darling I'm not sure you know what casual means
356	25	but, I will wear my tuxedo!
356	26	I actually own one!
356	27	Its traditional black, with a tailored jacket; it'll go with anything!
356	28	No go, says the bride.
356	29	You won't match then other groomsmen.
356	30	From her perch she decreed that she had picked out a tuxedo for me!
356	31	From the local rental shop....the one that did my prom tux.....5 years ago.
356	32	I arrive in good spirits, still determined to have a wonderful time with friends, only to find that for my broad shouldered frame which towers at a mighty 5 foot 6 inches, the bride had selected a 5 button tux which literally came down to my knees.
356	33	I looked like Mr Popper and his penguins had an unholy blood orgy with Morpheus.
356	34	But hey, it's her wedding, I'll be a good sport about it.
356	35	Even with the 200$ rush fee.
356	36	I collect my tux and grab a bite of lunch when I discover the best man, the grooms brother, had neglected to plan a bachelor party!
356	37	I volunteered and developed three plans from which the groom could choose.
356	38	These were multifaceted plans complete with drivers, activities, and extreme flexibility to suit his taste.
356	39	I also discreetly informed the groom of the approximate cost of each.
356	40	I think you all know his choice.
356	41	Option 3- the mega pimp package.
356	42	Complete with strippers, liquor, and dinner at a very nice restaurant.
356	43	After dinner we entered the gentlemen's club only to discover that the groom is tapped out!!
356	44	I give him half of his wedding preset to go have fun with.
356	45	This is immediately blown in 20 min.
356	46	It is at this point that the grooms friend from his kung fu class decided to believe that "no touching the girls" was more of a suggestion.
356	47	He was immediately and forcefully asked to leave.
356	48	He claimed he was getting a cab home.
356	49	Apparently a cab home was his way of saying I'm going to go sit in the car and drink the after party liquor and puke in aleandwhores back seat.
356	50	We found him, cleaned him up, and took him home.
356	51	Things were winding down after a few more bars and a trip to the adult book store in which I had to describe what various marital aids were for and how they were best implemented.
356	52	The next morning, Thursday, was set aside as a wedding prep day.
356	53	I cured the hangovers of the people I was told "knew how to party" and I set about sobering the groom up.
356	54	Somehow all of the fun of last night had started to give him cold feet.
356	55	He was mopey, withdrawn, and hostile.
356	56	But we still had
356	57	Shit to do!
356	58	After an hour of encouragement, we meet the brides cow of a mother to collect the cake.
356	59	Upon extending my hand to meet her I am met with "So you're the baby killer!
356	60	" flabbergasted I retorted with something like, "Just because your outfit is from the 60's doesn't mean you have to act like it.
356	61	" Suffice to say all parties were grossly offended.
356	62	But we get past it and collect various wedding equipment and store it at her church for Saturday.
356	63	It was a rather long day of motivating the groom to stop crying ( yes, crying) and to get up and help.
356	64	I am a nurse so comforting the crying is something I had experience with.
356	65	None the less he was almost in hysterics.
356	66	Friday rolls along and we are having the rehearsal dinner.
356	67	Her father has prepared it, and it was very good!
356	68	Veal lamb chops in wine sauce served with lots of sides and some type of fancy ale.
356	69	Her family are great medieval fair enthusiasts and this meal was reminiscent of this.
356	70	Along with dad and the brides brothers manner of speech.
356	71	They literally spoke like it was ye olde times.
356	72	Two grown ass men.
356	73	Swords decorated their walls and everyone drank out of those cheap metal tankards you buy at the medical fairs.
356	74	What I am getting at is that it was a little off putting.
356	75	But I rolled on and tried to make polite conversation with the brides brother as he sat in a church wearing a kilt and talking about his snakes.
356	76	(can you feel the neck beard from your desk?
356	77	) After several more rude anti-military comments and questioning of my sexuality for being a male nurse, dinner was over
356	78	and I took the groom home
356	79	and we had a nice long talk, encouraging him for tomorrow.
356	80	Finally Saturday has arrived!
356	81	We shower and dress and arrive on time for photos.
356	82	The bride takes me aside and thanks me for all the help and I feel much better!
356	83	I put their envelope gift in the basket and start helping out.
356	84	But wait.
356	85	The fun isn't over yet!
356	86	The best man hasn't wrote a speech!
356	87	Oh shit son.
356	88	I literally wrote it for him.
356	89	It was brief, funny, and heartwarming.
356	90	I even got a childhood memory from him to toss in to make it look authentic.
356	91	We do the wedding and it was pretty nice.
356	92	I have to say it was very pretty for their budget.
356	93	I guess I'll say while you could tell they didn't have much money, being very young and all, but it did not look cheap or tacky in any fashion.
356	94	The reception dinner starts and there is suddenly no room for me at the head table.
356	95	It's ok though at this point I'm tired and just want to sit with my date.
356	96	Which, according to the bride, would be fun to seat next to my ex girlfriend.
356	97	Dinner ended uneventfully, even if it was a little awkward.
356	98	I was tasked with returning all of the tuxes (funny thing, mind was the only non traditional one for some odd reason...) while the rest of the wedding party went to the bars.
356	99	This was the final straw.
356	100	My date and I dropped them off and went home.
356	101	It was not until the next day that the groom called me and said what a terrible guest I was and that I was no longer welcome in his home.
356	102	So after half a week of babysitting and practically running the groomsmen and 500$ later; I was the asshole.
356	103	Fuck him in his stupid face.
356	104	I didn't realize this was that long of a rant.
357	0	About 13 years ago my sister (young teen at the time) started dating her first boyfriend (kid was 19).
357	1	He was completely obsessed, would verbally abuse her, etc etc.
357	2	As far as I know his abuse never got physical, but after she broke up with him he'd creep around our parent's house, call the house at 3am just to hang up, threaten her...he pretty much managed to piss me off.
357	3	So, said guy worked at a driving school where he corrected test quizzes after hours.
357	4	I drove there one evening with a friend to give him one last warning, he told me to fuck off or he'd call the cops.
357	5	So my friend and I took out my friend's aluminum baseball bat out of the trunk, tuned up the kids car a bit and, when he came outside, took one good swing to his legs.
357	6	Then I told him he could call the cops now.
357	7	He never did, the phone calls stopped, I never saw him again.
357	8	Not quite the dramatic story, but it's all I got.
358	0	Not sure if I'm allowed to do this but this is from a post I made.
358	1	Copy pasta.
358	2	It was the summer of fourth grade and there was a new kid in the neighborhood.
358	3	Lets call him Jack.
358	4	Attempting to make the move easier I befriended him.
358	5	Over the summer we grew fairly close, I showed him what around town.
358	6	We rode bikes through the woods together, played football together and so on.
358	7	I went to his house or he would come to mine almost everyday.
358	8	It was great.
358	9	When school started we shared a seat on the bus and I introduced him to some of my other friends.
358	10	I helped him with school work and showed him around.
358	11	Eventually he started hanging out with another group of people but we were still fairly close outside of school.
358	12	After about a year we had almost entirely stopped hanging out.
358	13	We didn't hate each other or anything like that, but we grew apart.
358	14	He was hanging with the "cool" kids and I was still with my group.
358	15	Cut to sixth grade.
358	16	I was sitting on the bus again waiting for the next person to get on.
358	17	One of his "cool friends" says "Jack you are so awesome, you've changed a lot since fourth grade"
358	18	"Yea" says another one of his friends "you used to be so weird back then!
358	19	"
358	20	"Ha Ha Yea" Jack replied
358	21	Everyone laughed
358	22	But I was his friend back then I thought.
358	23	I felt pretty shitty.
358	24	He ended up staying for a few more years before moving away.
358	25	He had a large going away party.
358	26	I wasn't invited.
359	0	Northeastern grad (as of Monday, when I take my last exam-- hooray) here.
359	1	Our architecture program is... special.
359	2	Not the good kind of special.
359	3	Just... special.
359	4	The pavement outside the architecture building is covered with spray paint from them failing to understand how to use a tarp when making their fancy multicolored buildings.
359	5	God help you if you get in between them and their styrofoam trees.
360	0	So when I was like 11 or so I got really curious about sex and decided to try to simulate.
360	1	Being as innocent as I was i did not know what masturbation was much less how to do it properly and thought that sicking my dick in between a stuffed animals legs was good enough.
360	2	A few days later, after repeating my "experiment" several times, my penis began to turn red, swell up to about up to about 1.5 of its normal size an itch like a mothafucker.
360	3	I do not posses the skill with words to accurately describe how much my dick itched.
360	4	Every movement caused my pants leg to brush up against it causing it to itch only more.
360	5	My mother took me several doctors but none of them could tell my mother what was wrong with my penis (granted I never told them I routinely rubbed it against a stuffed animal).
360	6	Being the stupid kid I was I never made the connection between the inflammation of my dick and my unusual masturbation habits so once my penis returned to normal I resumed using stuffed animals as sex dolls which starting the whole thing all over again.
361	0	Holy shit.
361	1	I would've broken that fucking guy's neck.
361	2	Also, this is why I don't lend expensive stuff or do big favours.
361	3	Borrow a book?
361	4	Ok.
361	5	Borrow my car?
361	6	Fuck no, tell me where you need to go and I'll give you a ride there if I have the time.
361	7	Unless it's a really close friend I've known for years.
362	0	As a hairstylist, I've seen a few bridezillas.
362	1	This one affected me directly.
362	2	So mid week, a woman comes in and asks about updos for a wedding that upcoming weekend.
362	3	She told my boss that she wanted something "funky" done with her hair.
362	4	My boss then booked this bitch with me.
362	5	Saturday morning comes and she is in my chair and I get started.
362	6	I am nearly finished and she starts complaining that she wanted more of a classic Audrey Hepburn style.
362	7	Now I'm confused and it's too late to change now, plus my next client has arrived.
362	8	This twat loses it.
362	9	She says I wasn't listening to her and called her mother to come talk sense into me and was almost in tears wondering how she was going to explain her hair to her future inlaws.
362	10	Her mom shows and basically tells her that her hair looks beautiful, paid me and dragged her out of the salon.
362	11	A total WTF experience for everyone.
363	0	I used to work at Best Buy in Geek Squad and usually the people working the closing shifts had to clean up their departments and such.
363	1	We had just gotten a new manager who was an outside hire from Circuit City.
363	2	He was trying to be a hardass and flex his management powers by being a meticulous cunt about cleaning during closing duties asking shit like "Did you clean UNDER the registers and Windex and dust etc" about every little fucking thing.
363	3	A buddy of mine I was working with and I started our closing duties a little early since the store was pretty dead that night in order to be able to leave at a reasonable hour.
363	4	We pretty much wrapped up 15 minutes after the store closed so we got the manager to do a walkthrough so we could leave.
363	5	He's looking around and everything seems to be in order until he looks behind some signage on a shelf and runs his finger through picking up some dust.
363	6	He has this shit eating grin on his face and lets out a little weasely laugh and says "Looks like you guys still have some work to do.
363	7	" My buddy and I looked at eachother and we both just knew what had to be done.
363	8	We cleaned the entire department top to bottom, inside and out.
363	9	Every drawer was emptied, dusted, wiped down, brochures organized.
363	10	Every computer in the back was moved and the shelves were dusted and wiped, floors were vacuumed twice, top stock was neatly arranged, every inch of the department was gone over with a fine tooth comb, twice in some spots just to take longer.
363	11	10pm turned into midnight, everyone else was long gone except for us 3.
363	12	He was looking weary and tired.
363	13	Midnight turned into 2am and we were still going at it when he finally came out of the office red eyed and exhausted and said "Guys, let's go.
363	14	" "But we still haven't dusted under the counters and..."
363	15	"Its fine, lets go.
363	16	" Buddy and I took our sweet time gathering our things and clocking out.
363	17	We both were also off the next day and cunt manager had to be in early for a conference call so it made it all that much better.
363	18	Every time he was the closing manager after that night he never gave us trouble again, simply asking us if we were ready to go when the store closed.
363	19	Justice prevails.
364	0	This is late
364	1	but I gotta do it....
364	2	Growing up, I was always a picky eater.
364	3	When I was in the first grade, there was a giant ball cart that we would hang our backpacks on during school hours.
364	4	(*thing had hooks on top to put our backpacks on and the bottom was like a basket that held the four-square balls that we innocently played with.
364	5	*)
364	6	Anyway, every morning, there was so much commotion with all the tiny children hanging their over-sized backpacks on this cart that in that chaos, I would take the salami sandwich that was packed for me and would throw it into the cart.
364	7	(*Every ounce of my tiny first grade being HATED salami sandwiches and yet, I got one, every.damn.day.
364	8	*)
364	9	One fateful day, Mrs. Neumiller and her aid make an announcement about what was going on during circle time.
364	10	Not only did they want to know who had been doing it but they had a message of how lunch is important for us growing children and that we needed to eat.
364	11	I kept my mouth shut.
364	12	There was a girl in our class, Victoria T. who would get picked on.
364	13	(*She was the smelly kid/she did stupid things for attention*)
364	14	Naturally, all the kids blame her and with the rep she had, the teachers believed it.
364	15	She gets in trouble and though I feel bad, I realize that I can't say shit
364	16	so I just join in to hide my guilt.
364	17	Fast forward to my senior year of high school.
364	18	Me and my best friend since Kindergarten are on a flight back from Maui.
364	19	It's a 4+ hour flight so her
364	20	and I are talking
364	21	and I look her dead in the eye and go, "*I have to tell you something.
364	22	*"
364	23	**At this point, the bitch knows it serious.
364	24	**
364	25	"What is it?
364	26	"
364	27	"*You remember those sandwiches from first grade that Victoria T. got blamed for?
364	28	*"
364	29	"Yeah, she left her salami sandwiches in the ball cart.
364	30	"
364	31	"*Dude.
364	32	It was me.
364	33	Those were my sandwiches.
364	34	*"
364	35	"You're fucking kidding me right?!
364	36	I'm your BEST friend and you're only telling me NOW?!
364	37	Do you realized first grade was over ten years ago?!
364	38	"
364	39	"*You're the first person I'm telling!
364	40	I had to make sure I was in the fuckin' clear.
364	41	*"
364	42	We laughed until we cried for most of the flight and now you know.
364	43	**fixed typos/grammar and clarity*
365	0	I was living in Florida when a hurricane hit.
365	1	My girlfriend, who lived in Alabama, was staying with me.
365	2	Because the hurricane had knocked all of the power out, we had no air conditioning.
365	3	Trying to sleep in Florida in the middle of summer without air conditioning, is an almost impossible task.
365	4	Well, impossible for her since I was doing fine.
365	5	Around 1:00am she woke me up and said she couldn't sleep due to the heat.
365	6	Like most guys, I hate getting woken up in the middle of the night over something I have zero control over.
365	7	But being the considerate person I was, I said that we could go to my office building and see if the electricity was on there.
365	8	So we grabbed a blanket and some pillows and headed out.
365	9	When we got to the office, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that the power (and thus the air condition) were indeed on.
365	10	There was a small office with a loveseat tucked away from the front of the building, so I told her she could sleep on that and I would sleep on the floor.
365	11	About 10 minutes after finally closing my eyes and drifted off the sleep, she asked, "Are you tired.
365	12	" I replied, "Fuck yes I'm tired.
365	13	You woke me up to drive us up here.
365	14	Why?
365	15	" "No reason," she said.
365	16	That's the last thing she said and we both went to sleep.
365	17	The next morning as we were driving back to my house, she asked, "Do you know why I asked if I was tired last night?
365	18	" "Of course not," I said.
365	19	"It's because I wanted to give you a blowjob," she replied.
365	20	"Why?
365	21	" I asked.
365	22	"I don't know," she said, "I just felt like giving you one.
365	23	"
366	0	Dead ass tired, just pulled my truck into Flagstaff, AZ to pick up a load in the middle of the night.
366	1	It was cold &amp; windy, there was an uneasy chill in the air.
366	2	I talk to security &amp; go to drop my empty trailer so I can grab a full one.
366	3	I drop my trailer, no problem; time to go get my load &amp; gtfo.
366	4	I get my truck under the trailer &amp; get out to hook up &amp; check out my trailer.
366	5	That's when I heard it.
366	6	It was the un-holiest howl I've ever heard, like a pack of Hell hounds.
366	7	I felt a chill come over me as I'm kinda freaking out.
366	8	I get to the back of the trailer &amp; see that all the doors on all the trailer are open.
366	9	The wind was blowing so hard, it was causing the trailers to howl.
366	10	I laughed at myself &amp; drove to the next exit to get some rest.
367	0	Last night, I went to my boyfriend's for Halloween.
367	1	He's in student accommodation, and one of the girls on his floor has developed quite the desire for him.
367	2	She doesn't seem to consider my existence in all this, and quite simply, I wanted to show her that why yes, he does have a girlfriend.
367	3	So, even though everyone else was also free, I asked her to take a cute couple-y photo of us in our costumes.
367	4	To sorta.. drive home the point that he's mine.
367	5	Not as bad as some in this thread, but still quite petty.
368	0	I also lived in Shanghai--here is a breakdown of what happened:
368	1	Case goes to court-Judges agree with the woman's family and force the man to pay a portion her medical bills.
368	2	This makes the news and the lose their shit--the overall culture changes so that people refuse to help another without first getting evidence showing that they were not at fault.
368	3	Fast forward to a year ago--a little girl named Xiao Yue Yue gets hit by a truck somewhere in Guangdong province.
368	4	Nearly twenty people walk by without doing anything to help, little girl eventually dies.
368	5	Chinese people freak out once again--a new law gets hastily passed that protects people from being sued when they try to help someone else.
368	6	Not sure if it will be actually enforced or not.
369	0	When I was 5, I was at a grocery store with my mum and there was a homeless man sitting outside.
369	1	We went into the store and bought a loaf of bread to give him.
369	2	When we paid and left, my mum gave it to me to give to him and when I did, he tried to spit at me.
369	3	He started screaming that bread won't pay for beer and weed and yelled at me to go away and bring money next time.
369	4	My mum and I quickly left after that, but as a 5 year old, all I wanted to do was be kind, like I'd been taught.
369	5	It really upset 5-year-old me.
370	0	So it's junior year in high school, I'm in first period theology (catholic school) and I'm tired as hell, ironically.
370	1	There's a cute blonde sitting in front of me and a cuter redhead in back.
370	2	Despite being tired, I flirt with both of them before class starts, but more so with the redhead; I'm feeling good about life.
370	3	So when class begins, satisfied, I put my head down and descend into the deepest of in-class slumbers.
370	4	What felt like about half way into class, I'm awoken by the most ungodly sounding flatulence; I mean this was a like a bear fart.
370	5	I raise my head, in my drowsy stupor, wondering who it may have been and notice the entire class and teacher are looking towards my side of the class.
370	6	Being tired, I apathetically put my head back down to sleep, but only to be jolted awake, seconds later, by the realization that it was me!
370	7	I fucking farted my self awake!
370	8	I mean, I had felt my desk vibrate!
370	9	Needless to say, that was the last time I ever flirted with the either the blonde or the redhead (who probably got a pretty good idea of what my asshole smells like), or anyone who was in the class for that matter.
371	0	My brother's first wife wouldn't allow any of our family that she hadn't met into the wedding.
371	1	Now, we've got a good size-family, so this would mean things like inviting one cousin that she'd met, but not their parents or siblings that lived out of town, etc.
371	2	We offered to hold an engagement party so she could get to know some of our out-of-towners, but she declined, saying she didn't want to feel obligated to invite these new family members that she'd only met once and didn't know very well.
371	3	In the end, we decided to go with immediate family only, we figured it would be less awkward and rude than to pick-and-choose between family.
371	4	My brother ended up having 6 people at his wedding, along with around 65 from the bride's side.
372	0	The first time I masturbated it was autofellatio.
372	1	I had discovered porn by then (middle school age, I think), but I didn't know how ejaculation happened.
372	2	I thought that it would happen on its own when you were sufficiently aroused.
372	3	I didn't know how to masturbate.
372	4	Then one day I decided to blow myself.
372	5	I was young enough for this to work (it's harder to stretch that far when you get older).
372	6	I didn't know to move my mouth back and forth.
372	7	I just put my mouth on my penis and held it there.
372	8	After a while I came on the floor (fortunately there wasn't much of a mess).
372	9	I soon learned how people normally masturbate and I've lost my ability to perform autofellatio because I got too old.
373	0	I've actually posted this [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a7b8t/my_brother_met_a_girl_online_and_fell_madly_in/c0g6px6).
373	1	True story:
373	2	My good friend (I'll call him Andrew for the sake of his privacy, just in case) had been talking to a girl (Lily) from the UK for almost a year online.
373	3	She was cute, sweet, and had all kinds of friends and a loving family.
373	4	Lily had hundreds of photos and anecdotes and a seemingly real life.
373	5	Her friends and family would all post comments on her MySpace page telling her how they had an awesome weekend, that they want to hang out with her soon, that they're sorry they missed her call, happy birthday, etc etc.
373	6	Eventually, Andrew started to have deep feelings for Lily.
373	7	He told his parents about her, then his close friends.
373	8	Andrew bought endless amounts of calling cards and would phone her whenever convenient for them both.
373	9	At about 9 months into it, Lily expressed an interest in moving to the US so she could be closer to Andrew.
373	10	There had been talk about moving in together.
373	11	Lily told Andrew she had spoken to her parents, and they suggested that she visit with a friend before committing to a move.
373	12	Andrew was over the goddamn moon.
373	13	He walked around for weeks talking about Lily and how amazing she was and how she was going to be visiting for a week and we all had to meet her.
373	14	When Andrew picked up Lily and her friend from the airport, Lily wasn't there.
373	15	The two individuals he met called themselves Jenny and Sam; sister and brother, or so they claimed.
373	16	The story was that Lily became anxious and nervous about flying overseas to meet the love of her life and swapped her ticket out for Sam at the last minute.
373	17	Jenny and Sam were supposed to see if Andrew was who he claimed to be, as well as scope out the area and check out the town.
373	18	When Andrew returned home, he talked online with Lily for a few hours with her apologising profusely.
373	19	He reassured her, told her it was okay, and that he understood her nervousness.
373	20	I met Jenny and Sam at a party.
373	21	Andrew was towing them everywhere, trying to impress them so that they had only good things to report back to Lily.
373	22	Jenny and Sam were... normal.
373	23	They stuck together the whole time, drank some beers, laughed at jokes, struck up conversations.
373	24	The only thing that could have seemed odd was the amount of photos they were taking.
373	25	But at the same time, it was assumed that they were trying to document their trip for Lily.
373	26	A couple of days before Jenny and Sam had to leave, they told Andrew the truth (honestly, I don't know if its the real truth, and I don't think I'll ever know).
373	27	Their names weren't Jenny and Sam.
373	28	They weren't related.
373	29	There was no Lily.
373	30	Lily was really someone named Alicia.
373	31	All the photos of Lily on MySpace were taken from Alicia's MySpace.
373	32	The photos of family members and friends were all Alicia's friends, but with different names.
373	33	All of the comments on Lily's profile and photos were fabricated.
373	34	They were put there by these fake friends and relations.
373	35	Alicia had no idea that this doppleganger profile existed.
373	36	Alicia had no idea that Andrew existed.
373	37	Jenny and Sam told Andrew that there was a fake profile for him as well.
373	38	They showed it to him.
373	39	His doppleganger was named Justin or something like that.
373	40	Justin had all of the same family members and friends that Andrew had, but with different names.
373	41	They told Andrew they'd been playing this game for a while, but it wasn't just them.
373	42	They could count 20 people off the top of their head that were in on this game, from all over the world.
373	43	Then they pulled out this book for Andrew to look at.
373	44	This is the part that really freaked me the fuck out.
373	45	It was a book of Andrew's life.
373	46	Every single piece of information Andrew had shared with Lily was documented in this book.
373	47	There would be an excerpt from their chat logs (i.e.
373	48	Andrew: "hung out with Brian today.
373	49	he's my bestfriend.
373	50	" Lily: "oh yeah?
373	51	thats the guy with you in your default photo, right?
373	52	"), any pertinent information (i.e.
373	53	a photo of Brian and a brief description of who he is to Andrew), and footnotes.
373	54	The footnotes were extensive and unbelievable.
373	55	In this example of Brian, it would include things like 1- dating Karen P (page 22)
373	56	2- was in a band with Eric J (page 17) and Mike C (page 9)
373	57	3- is Brad D's younger brother (page 11).
373	58	The amount of linked information in this book was the biggest mindfuck.
373	59	It was an extensive web of the network of friends and family in our group.
373	60	It included all kinds of information and photos.
373	61	Jenny and Sam had admitted to taking all the photos on their trip so that they could add to this book, and add to the profiles online.
373	62	Andrew kept the book and refused to give it back to them.
373	63	He kicked them out of his house.
373	64	He was heartbroken and shocked.
373	65	Later on, he logged onto his messenger client and Lily IMed him.
373	66	He told her he knew that she wasn't real, that this had been a giant whatthefuckery and he wanted to know what the person pretending to be Lily had to gain.
373	67	Lily didn't respond.
373	68	Lily stopped talking to Andrew.
373	69	Andrew has never received a real answer in regards to what he endured.
373	70	I saw the book before Andrew shredded and burned it.
373	71	There was a photo and a small little blurb about me in there.
373	72	1- Recently moved from [unknown city], California.
373	73	2- Dating Aaron B (page 6), city police officer.
373	74	3- Good friends with Allison S (page 26) and Reid P (page 21)
373	75	4- Hates soda, gum, flipflops; loves Harry Potter, beer, cookies.
374	0	I recently posted a comment (no throwaway) about this girl I was into always talking to her ex-boyfriend and how it made me nervous.
374	1	3 days later, she texted me a direct link to my specific comment that was buried in /r/adviceanimals.
374	2	I told her that doesn't change the way I feel about her ex-boyfriend and we pretty much went downhill from there.
374	3	Big argument erupted and we are no longer speaking.
374	4	Also lost one of my friends who happened to be her best friend as a result.
374	5	In fact, there is a good chance she will see this comment since she was seemingly keeping tabs on me.
374	6	Hi, crazy.
375	0	Oh nooooo.
375	1	My boyfriend's landlord is my French teacher from high school.
375	2	It's not a bad situation-
375	3	I was a good student, and it's not like the landlord is over all the time.
375	4	One day, the boy was going down on me-
375	5	it was the middle of the day and nobody else was home, so I felt no fear in loudly expressing my appreciation.
375	6	Once I had finished, there was a sharp knock on the door of his room.
375	7	"Hey, rent's due... Good job!
375	8	" the landlord called.
375	9	Apparently he had been standing out there waiting.
375	10	While I appreciate his allowing me to finish, I still can't look the guy in the face.
376	0	Pretty strange story, especially from my current twentysomething perspective.
376	1	When I was eight or nine, my family took a trip with my dad to Toronto because he was going there for business.
376	2	He would do this often - take us on trips with him instead of being gone for long periods.
376	3	We get to this nice hotel - my parents, myself, and my two brothers (one seven and one only nine months old).
376	4	The hotel is one of the biggest I'd ever seen at that age.
376	5	In my opinion it would be hard to keep running to the same people all day in this complex.
376	6	The next day, my dad heads off to his appointment, and my mom decides to take us to breakfast.
376	7	We're at our table in the hotel cafe when this mid-thirties/early forties couple approaches us.
376	8	Otherwise unassuming, but their behavior was strange.
376	9	They offered to feed my youngest brother for my mom while she ate her breakfast.
376	10	My mom was a bit overprotective with us when I was young, so I was surprised when she acted so calm (but firm) in telling them no thank you.
376	11	They insisted twice more before leaving us to it and exiting the cafe.
376	12	Later on, my mom was taking us to this shopping complex that was underneath/connected to the hotel.
376	13	We saw the couple following us through a part of the mall.
376	14	My mom made us stop and go into a store until they passed us and left.
376	15	At this point, my seven-year-old brother and I are looking at each other and thinking that this isn't normal.
376	16	My mom decides that this MIGHT be a weird coincidence.
376	17	A little later, we decide to head back to the hotel and go swimming.
376	18	The pool is large - so large that it stretches from indoors to outside.
376	19	While my brother and I are in the water, my mom has the littlest one with her sitting on a deck chair.
376	20	Lo and behold the couple is at the pool as well!
376	21	They're sitting right across the pool from my mom just STARING at her.
376	22	She tells us shortly after that we should leave and go back to the hotel room because my dad would be back soon and want to go to dinner.
376	23	Again, my brother and I are thinking that this is really strange despite how young/naive we were.
376	24	The best part is when my dad finally does return to the hotel room, he knocks and doesn't announce himself.
376	25	My brother and I run into the bathroom and close the door to hide because we assumed it was that crazy couple!
377	0	When I was in middle school my friends and I were hanging out on a trampoline in the backyard late at night maybe like 11 pm or so.
377	1	The backyards are all "connecting" meaning there is trees and small fences separating them but you can walk through them.
377	2	Some guy comes through and asks if we have seen a little orange tabby cat and we told him no.
377	3	He said he lives around the corner if we see it he will give us a reward.
377	4	Okay cool.
377	5	We think nothing of it and go back to talking about Pokemon cards and why Charizard is a god on paper.
377	6	No joke, 2 min after this guy leaves this little car wanders through and we think "is that the cat he was talking about?
377	7	" My friend grabs it and we all proudly march to the guys house to collect our reward.
377	8	The guy is sitting on his front porch and we bring the cat to him.
377	9	He's so excited and says "Oh I have the reward inside just come in and I'll give it to you.
377	10	" We were kinda sketched out but we decided 2 go in and 2 stay.
377	11	He says "oh if you don't come in I can only give the reward to the ones that come in" He was gonna give us $100 a person to go in.
377	12	Still we had 2 guys go in and take what felt like forever but they came out and had $200 with them.
377	13	They said there was plastic on everything in there and something felt wrong.
377	14	I feel as though if we all went we would have been killed.
377	15	But keeping 2 outside that knew where their friends were I guess was enough to deter him.
377	16	Still was a weird occurrence.
378	0	A few months ago, I was enjoying some porn and stumbled across my cousin.
378	1	She is on a free cam website, and although for the most part she doesn't show her face, there is no doubt that it is her.
378	2	The thing that is messed up is that once I recognized it was her, I kept watching, and have become a regular viewer in her room.
378	3	She has no idea who I am.
378	4	I suppose I should feel guilty, but I don't.
379	0	I went out of town for my best friends wedding in which I was a bridesmaid.
379	1	I didn't take my boyfriend at the time as per request of the bride.
379	2	It is her day and considering my bf and I were on the outs at the time I was not opposed to this.
379	3	He's an ADD kid and didnt get his meds refilled before I left town for four days.
379	4	This is his meltdown.
379	5	Started off ok, we would text back and forth but I wouldn't be able to reply as fast because...
379	6	Duh I'm helping with a wedding.
379	7	He overdosed on Valium and told me he was wandering around outside.
379	8	Then doesn't answer his phone for SIX HOURS.
379	9	In which I'm panicking cause I'm a six hour drive away from my home and idk if he's wandered off in his fucked up state or not.
379	10	I break down, my best friends stepdad, an ex-cop sits with me and lets me know some options on what I can do from far away.
379	11	Eventually I sent my apartment manager over to see if he had left te house or not.
379	12	Apparently he had FALLEN ASLEEP cause he took so many drugs.
379	13	The actual day of the ceremony he flips out again because I don't have time to talk to him at all.
379	14	Tensions are high for the wedding party as we are pushing to get this ceremony on its way.
379	15	I leave my phone in my bag while I help the bride and groom.
379	16	Come back to no less than 10 voicemails and 30+ texts, half of it incoherent "hdjwkfisiajdj" style typing.
379	17	This continues the whole weekend.
379	18	I stop responding.
379	19	Come home to find my blinds torn, DVD player smashed, cooking oil spilled all over my kitchen floor (that HE made me clean up because apparently it was my fault he knocked it over while I wasn't even in town) and my entire nail polish collection (over 50 colors) destroyed, I'm still finding cracked bottles, it's amazing how I haven't died from all those fumes.
379	20	Red colored kool aid splashed EVERYWHERE.
379	21	Even INSIDE KITCHEN DRAWERS
379	22	I don't even know how that happened.
379	23	He didnt apologize for any of it, his only words were "you made me do it.
379	24	If you hadn't ignored me this would have never happened.
379	25	"
379	26	We are no longer together of course but this is just one episode of many.
379	27	This man will be 30 next month.
379	28	I pity his next girlfriend.
380	0	This'll get buried but:
380	1	I'm standing in line at the Apple Store getting a new phone case, and there's someone in front of me.
380	2	This person in front of me has god awful hair.
380	3	It has knots everywhere and there all these little bead things.
380	4	I stand there thinking "God, what an *ugly* woman this must be".
380	5	She turns around.
380	6	It's motherfucking Steven Tyler.
381	0	Well, this is going to be super buried, and I don't really want to type out the story of how my uncle accidentally set off a still active German air raid siren if no one is going to read it.
381	1	.
381	2	.
382	0	My mom tells a story of her and her friend.
382	1	Let's call her friend Lisa.
382	2	When my mom and Lisa were teenagers, they were up on the roof of Lisa's house, and they see a bright light in the sky.
382	3	Next thing they know, the light is gone.
382	4	Thing is, they think they've been on the roof for like 15 minutes, but something like 3 hours passed.
382	5	Mom doesn't remember anything about what happened during that time, and Lisa simply refuses to talk about it.
382	6	She would answer my mom with things like "I dunno" and "Just drop it.
382	7	" for a long time.
382	8	So a couple months later, mom moves away and loses contact with Lisa for about 10 years.
382	9	She finally meets up with her again and immediately notices that something is odd about Lisa.
382	10	Lisa appeared very "distant" to her, with a very "dreamy" demeanor.
382	11	Like she was really happy and at peace, for no good reason.
382	12	After they talk for a bit, Lisa brings up the incident on the roof.
382	13	Mom says she still doesn't really remember anything about it.
382	14	But Lisa remembers.
382	15	She remembers everything.
382	16	She said that at first, it was all in bits and pieces and she couldn't remember any of it clearly.
382	17	She was confused and scared and wanted to avoid discussing it.
382	18	Then, as time passed, she began to remember more of it.
382	19	She remembers it all clearly, and she remembers the other 3 times she was abducted after that clearly as well.
382	20	At first, they paralyzed her somehow and did all sorts of invasive experiments on her, but by the most recent time, they stopped probing her and began to talk with her.
382	21	They didn't speak English or any other human language, but she could understand everything they said, even though she can't speak their language herself.
382	22	Apparently they told her all sorts of things - stuff about space, Earth itself, and most shockingly, predicted years beforehand that she would get pregnant in a specific year and it would also be a stillborn, and that she would never be able to have children again.
382	23	They also told her that it was not their fault and they even made an attempt to save her from this fate, but they were unsuccessful.
382	24	They also told her that they had abducted my mother.
382	25	Another time, after that first incident.
382	26	Mom says she has no recollection of any other potential abductions, but she does have recurring nightmares of being abducted, but she's "almost sure" that they're just that - nightmares.
382	27	Anyway, Lisa tells mom that every time she speaks with them, she comes to understand "the truth" more and more.
382	28	When mom inquires what "the truth" is, Lisa just says that "you will know eventually", and she says that once she learned of "the truth", then "everything became wonderful".
382	29	Mom has seen her a few more times over the years (we still live in another state from her), and she apparently has a pretty normal life, and doesn't like, obsess over alien stuff (like some supposed alien abductees do), she only ever brings it up in passing, not like it's a central part of her daily life.
383	0	Winter Formal was coming up and a girl I'd known since 5th grade asked me to be her date, because her and her boyfriend had split about a month before, and she said that he wouldn't care.
383	1	She said she'd pay for everything, she just needed a date.
383	2	So I agreed.
383	3	The next day people begin to start calling me "Scandal of the Year".
383	4	Apparently after I agreed to go with her she called her ex and told him I asked her to the dance.
383	5	She knew he would get jealous and come back for his lady.
383	6	Somehow she also convinced him I was the reason they split in the first place.
383	7	He sent a forward out to the entire senior class calling me the scandal of the year, and saying that he was gonna kick my ass.
383	8	He was THE state champion wrestler.
383	9	The thing that pissed me off the most though was that I loaned her the money for the tickets, the tickets that her and her bf used to go to the dance together.
383	10	He called and said that if I ever ask her for the money back he'll put me in a coma.
383	11	And that is why I never went to Formal my senior year.
383	12	Fucking bitch.
384	0	When I was a kid (15ish) I saved my friend from choking.
384	1	Gave him the ole heimlich.
384	2	It was during a 4th of july celebration.
384	3	We were up in his room at the time playing video games by ourselves.
384	4	After I SAVED HIS FUCKING life, we went down stairs
384	5	and I was holding my head up with a sense of pride.
384	6	When the family asked me why I was beaming, I told them what happened and they proceeded to ridicule me for the rest of the day calling me "hero" sarcastically.
384	7	I never got a thank you.
384	8	I didn't understand what the fuck was wrong with that family.
384	9	I still don't.
384	10	But as an adult I learned they were scientologists.
384	11	I consider that karma enough.
385	0	About a year ago, an online friend's cat ran away.
385	1	He was inconsolable, since he grew up with the cat and it was basically one of his best friends.
385	2	I vaguely recalled him telling me a long time ago that the cat had run away for three days once, and had gotten stuck in a local barbecue restaurant while it was closed for the weekend.
385	3	I didn't mention it, because I figured it would make my friend more upset.
385	4	Three days later, the cat comes back, smelling like barbecue sauce because it got stuck in the restaurant over the weekend.
385	5	My friend swears the cat had never run away before, and I could find no record of the supposed "cat ran away" conversation in any of our chat logs.
385	6	He never even mentioned there was a barbecue restaurant near his house.
386	0	House was a compleate mess.
386	1	I recently started hitting the gym in the mornings because I'm carrying around 20 extra pounds of love.
386	2	I descided I woud skip the gym for a change and tidy up.
386	3	I spent all morning cleaning out the fridge, mopping, cleaning up the closet... the whole nine yards.
386	4	When my husband came home in the evening he was very happy.
386	5	We both work full time jobs so it leaves little time to cleaning.
386	6	Then he asked me how the gym went.
386	7	I told him oviously enough I did not go.
386	8	How else would I have cleaned and cooked the dinner I just cooked from scratch.
386	9	He looked at me with disgust and asked me if I had looked in a mirror lateley and if I knew how fat I was.
386	10	That SOB !
386	11	I left the house that night.
387	0	A long time ago I lent an asshole kid I knew $40.
387	1	But I had known him for a while, so I figured he would at least pay the money back.
387	2	A couple of weeks passed with no offer to pay me back.
387	3	Finally we're in the same car group heading to a local strip club.
387	4	"Hey," I remind him.
387	5	"You still owe me that $40, remember?
387	6	"
387	7	"**Fuck you**, americanpegasus" he says (though he of course uses my real name).
387	8	*Ok, really?
387	9	* I think.
387	10	*Game on.
387	11	*
387	12	So I let this kid get really drunk at the strip club.
387	13	And then I buy him a few more drinks.
387	14	And then I encourage our friends to buy him some drinks.
387	15	Finally, when we get to the cheap hotel, when this little shit is probably a couple of Bud Lights away from straight-up alcohol poisoning, and is too drunk to even wake up to get out of the car, I take his wallet and find $65 in it.
387	16	*Interest, mother fucker.
387	17	*
387	18	The next morning at breakfast he's raving, "Someone robbed me at the strip club, yo!
387	19	"
387	20	And I look right in his eyes and say, "Yeah, I don't give a shit.
387	21	You still owe me $40 and I need it by next week too.
387	22	"
388	0	Did this one to my brother.
388	1	Struggling hard in med school being on call (fall 2000), I decided to do some quick shopping and grab a bite to eat.
388	2	My bro comes with.
388	3	I'M buying some thing from an electronic store, checking out...
388	4	Then ... Can't find him.
388	5	He's gone.
388	6	Wait around...
388	7	Getting pissed.
388	8	Finally I see him and just...
388	9	Unload on him.
388	10	Tore a strip off of him.
388	11	"where the F___ were you?
388	12	I'm so tired why would you waste my time!?
388	13	" Scream at him all the way to the car.
388	14	We get in, and he pulls out "Arcanum", a video game I was wanting.
388	15	"I...
388	16	Uh...
388	17	Thought I'd surprise you with this when you got home.
388	18	"
388	19	I cried for a good 30 minutes.
388	20	Still feel like crying just writing the story.
388	21	(btw we are twins so there was only me being a fool....
388	22	Not being naturally worried.
388	23	)
388	24	Sorry bro.
389	0	There are already 3022 submissions so this will probably get buried, but here is a true story:
389	1	In the late 70's, my Uncle was studying medicine at the University of Chicago.
389	2	After a morning class, he decided that he would hitchhike back home to Lincoln Park on the North side instead of pay for a taxi.
389	3	A man drove up in a Plymouth Satellite and offered my Uncle a ride.
389	4	The man looked normal and seemed friendly...lighthearted even, so my Uncle got in the car and they started driving towards Lake Shore Drive.
389	5	However, once they got there, the man drove South on Lake Shore instead of North, towards Lincoln Park.
389	6	My Uncle told the man he was going the wrong way and to turn around and head North.
389	7	The man looked at my Uncle, put his hand on his knee and said, "No son, you are coming with me" and smiled darkly at him.
389	8	My Uncle froze in panic, and when they hit traffic near the South Shore, he quickly unlocked the passenger door and ran away without looking back.
389	9	A year or two later on a cold December day, my Uncle was having coffee in a cafe with my future Aunt when he caught something on the TV that made his blood run cold.
389	10	He saw the man that had picked him up from school that day the year before.
389	11	He had been arrested for the suspected rape and killing of over 20 young men and boys.
389	12	The man on the television was John Wayne Gacy.
389	13	And he had removed the door handle off the passenger side door to prevent the men he picked up from escaping.
390	0	I jumped in the middle of a fight to try and defend my friend.
390	1	I was the only one who got an assault charge.
390	2	Got forcibly taken to the hospital, against my wishes (I was fine.
390	3	) Had to put my life on hold while facing court cases, homelessness, and unable to find work instead of enlisting in the Air Force like I had planned on doing 2 days after this all happened.
390	4	Thanks to some asshat losing my paperwork, I am now STILL in this boat, facing a warrant for my arrest even though I never did anything truly wrong.
391	0	After being bullied for over 8 years due to her height, my younger sister was diagnosed with depression.
391	1	I was pretty sick of the shit girls would say to her by the time I was in tenth grade, and I wanted her to get back at them
391	2	but she never knew how.
391	3	As I was walking past the girls change room one day after school I caught my sister bawling her eyes out due to so something one of the girls had said to her.
391	4	Being absolutely furious that I had to witness my younger sister crying, I asked what had happened.
391	5	The girl had been teasing her about her depression and telling her that she was an attention whore, so I demanded to know where this girl was.
391	6	My sister obviously refused to tell me, so I went looking in the change room.
391	7	The second I walked in I thought about the repercussions of what I was about to do, but then I saw the girl on the other side of the room, talking about my sister to a large group of people.
391	8	She looked over at me and gave me the most horrible look you could imagine.
391	9	Although i had never before resorted to violence, or even to getting involved with my sisters bullies, I walked over to her as quietly as I could and promptly punched her in the face.
391	10	All of the bullying from there on on out stopped, but that is the story of how I got suspended from school on my sixteenth birthday.
392	0	My friends and I were at the beach a few weeks ago.
392	1	We saw this flock of seagulls poking at this bag of flaming hot Cheetos.
392	2	Once they got it flipped over and spilled onto the sand, they devoured them.
392	3	While they were eating, I said "Hey wouldn't it be funny if they realized how hot they were?
392	4	" Not ten seconds later, in a huge flock, they ALL flew into the water in panic, plunging their heads into the waves, beaks open.
393	0	It involves an apartment in a complex in Coney Island in the 80s.
393	1	Seemingly deserted, the man inside invited me over to trade video games, which happened, but inside that apt... a refrigerator loaded top to bottom with pudding cups.
393	2	Three grand pianos covered in canvas tarps stuffed like puzzle pieces in the largest room, barely fitting (had to crawl over or under them) with a full ballroom chandelier (hung from the ceiling but too big to fit so it draped over the pianos.
393	3	) Absolutely no furniture or electric appliances (except the fridge, his computer, and The Fan), no lamps, no tv, no toaster, nothing.
393	4	His bedroom had a bunk bed (he lived alone) and the window had been removed completely and replaced with a massive industrial fan that blew air into the room like a hurricane - this fan would blow floppy disks off the desk so they were weighted down with pudding cups.
393	5	He lived on the 13th floor.
393	6	The man himself was (I shit you not) absolutely normal looking.
393	7	I have no idea how I made it out of there alive; god smiles on fools and madmen, and this story had both.
394	0	When i was in beauty school I met this girl named Emily.
394	1	She needed somewhere to live because she needed to serve a house arrest sentence and couldn't do it where she was currently located because everyone that lived there did drugs.
394	2	We had been friends for a few months by then so I offered to split the rent on a one bedroom apartment so she could handle this court thing.
394	3	Not entirely unselfish, I needed a place to live and the rent was too damn high in California for me to live alone.
394	4	We weren't romantic or anything
394	5	so i slept on the couch and gave her the room.
394	6	A few months go by
394	7	and I realize she is a PIG.
394	8	She threw parties every night and never cleaned up.
394	9	In fact, the ONE time she did clean, she bitched for months about how messy I was.
394	10	Classy.
394	11	This was my schedule; wake up, clean house, go to school, clean house again, study, clean house before i went to bed.
394	12	They partied all day every day, and guess what!
394	13	We got evicted for noise complaint.
394	14	That never goes away, ever.
394	15	I tried to make her stop being loud but she always had like four guys over that were more than willing to kick my ass.
394	16	Also when i tried to have a descent grown-ass-people conversation with her about the messiness, late rent, and general craziness of the situation, she slapped me in the face AND BROKE MY VERSACE GLASSES.
394	17	Fuck that braud.
395	0	I was in class one day, sitting in a group of three people including myself.
395	1	We were talking and my friend dropped his pen on the desk.
395	2	I saw it stall in mid air for a second then drop on his desk.
395	3	My friend asked "Did anyone else see that?
395	4	" All my friends saw it, and it was just the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
395	5	To this day I have no explanation for it.
396	0	I killed a man named Frank in 1987.
396	1	He was a hitchhiker that I picked up in Utah.
396	2	He asked me to pull the car over, so he could go to the bathroom.
396	3	I had been feeling uncomfortable about him leading up to that, I suspect he sensed that.
396	4	When I pulled over, he pulled out a knife and told me to get out of the car.
396	5	I don't know why I didn't get out, but I lunged for the knife.
396	6	He stabbed me in my left arm.
396	7	I grabbed the knife with my right hand and put my forearm across his neck, like a choke hold.
396	8	He spat in my eye.
396	9	I sliced his throat, it was reactionary.
396	10	Fast.
396	11	I was reeling back from the spit.
396	12	It was all so fluid really.
396	13	I was back in the drivers side as he grabbed his throat and began flailing around.
396	14	He reached out to me.
396	15	It was too dark to see what expression he had, but I kicked him back against the passanger side door and held him there with my legs until his body went limp.
396	16	After what seemed like 2 hours, I dragged him out of the car and drove off.
397	0	Not so much a pre-wedding bridezilla story, but during.
397	1	I was a bridesmaid in my older brother's wedding.
397	2	I had 2 fucking drinks at the wedding...2!
397	3	I felt fine.
397	4	My sister in law got mad because in one of the wedding photos there is one of me kissing a family friend of 15 years on the cheek because I haven't seen them in a while.
397	5	It was such a nice picture too.
397	6	The bitch said it was inappropriate and hasn't shown the wedding photos from the reception to anyone because: "3ll3hciM was drinking at my wedding and ruined some of the pictures".
398	0	I dated a girl from okc.
398	1	She was a cna(certified nursing assistant) that did home health care for terminal cancer end of life management as well as people with als.
398	2	So she would go to people's houses and help them eat, bath, pay bills and so on, or with those dying she would help make them more comfortable and literally be there sometimes when they passed.
398	3	After dating her for way too long I found out that she was stealing from her clients.
398	4	She was stealing from dying people, literally watching people die knowing that she had taken what was theirs as well as helping them pay bills and trying to comfort them in their financial distress as she stole from them from the other room that they were incapable of going to.
398	5	I asked her why she would do this, I gave her money all the time and she lived with her dad and only had a phone payment.
398	6	She said she wanted to be a strong person, and I guess preying on the dead and dying somehow made her feel strong.
398	7	Dropped it like it was hot and reported what I knew to her employer.
398	8	They did nothing and the police weren't interested in an exboyfriend's words.
398	9	Last I heard she's still a can, though now she looks like she hit the meth.
398	10	So many other terrible okc stories...
398	11	don't know why I'm still on there...
399	0	I was on the New Jersey turnpike at about 3 am with a load of pork coming out of PA.
399	1	I'm just driving along singing along to the radio when I notice a shadow way up in high beams.
399	2	I start slowing down and try to figure out what this thing is.
399	3	I thought maybe it was a deer or something.
399	4	No, it wasnt a deer, it was a goddamned horse.
399	5	There was a horse trotting down the interstate.
400	0	I had a bridezilla moment once.
400	1	I'm generally pretty laid back and wanted to have a stress free wedding.
400	2	I gave my girls a color and let them wear what they wanted.
400	3	I was more excited than nervous or stressed.
400	4	But.
400	5	This damn caterer, who from day one went on and on about no hidden charges and his price was all inclusive, called me the day before my wedding to ask if I had found a rental company to supply the glassware and chairs for the reception...
400	6	I nearly lost my shit.
400	7	It ended up being a red solo cup reception.
401	0	Similar story, retail when I was in school.
401	1	Watched a four year old roaming around my store.
401	2	He came from the Disney store where I watched him put toys into his backpack and walk out.
401	3	He comes in my store and is climbing on everything.
401	4	He climbed our outdoor hammock and I grabbed him *last second* as it toppled over.
401	5	The mom rushed into the store, she was at a phone kiosk outside of the store entrance &gt;( and started yelling "that's why we don't shop at this mall, look how they treat black people!
401	6	", insert further racist comments directed at me and manager, etc.
401	7	Lots of profanity and screaming.
401	8	It ended with her yelling loudly "She don't think he's smart!
401	9	Say your ABCs for the lady!
401	10	Say em proud!
401	11	" and then forced him to say his ABCs o.o We called security for the assault and the theft (which she loudly denied and wouldn't check his backpack)
402	0	A number of* years ago I was at a party, heavily liquored up, when all of a sudden a fight broke out.
402	1	When I noticed one of my friends was getting beat up, I jumped in to save him and thus got the shit kicked out of me by a number of coked out gentlemen.
402	2	In the midst of the chaos and between consciousness/drunkenness I managed to get the pocket knife out of my pocket and I latched on to the nearest fucker I could get my hands on, I ended up on the back of the biggest guy and I slashed across his neck.
402	3	He made it to the hospital to get stitches and rather than press charges, declared a vendetta; the state thought differently and carried through with the charges themselves.
402	4	They charged me with attempted manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon.
402	5	I took a deal and did 395 days in a medium security state penitentiary.
402	6	I haven't seen him since but I know we both have families, lives, futures...
402	7	my only hope is that he has long since forgiven me and now lives in peace.
402	8	The only thing I regret about the whole ordeal, is that I didn't get to this thread any sooner.
403	0	When I was around 7 or 8 years old I would have this really disturbing dream which would repeat night after night.
403	1	I apologize if its somewhat hard to follow but it was a dream after all.
403	2	Nevertheless the dream starts out at a playground filled with children.
403	3	This playground is situated in a meadow about half the size of a football/soccer field.
403	4	Surrounding the meadow is a forest.
403	5	It looked similar to the forest in the Harry Potter.
403	6	Despite it being quite sunny in the meadow, the forest appeared to be shrouded in shadow.
403	7	I remember that while staring into the forest a deep sense of dread would come over me and I could almost feel something evil staring back at me.
403	8	The dream then changes instantly.
403	9	I am now standing at the top of the stairs in my house.
403	10	On the ground floor of my house I can see people running around, But somethings wrong.
403	11	They're screaming and somethings chasing them.
403	12	One by one the screams fall silent.
403	13	At this point I feel incredibly sad for the people who where downstairs, I feel as if I knew them.
403	14	I then see it.
403	15	It looks like a women covered in a black tattered robe.
403	16	She is slightly translucent and her pitch black eyes are fixed on me.
403	17	She then starts to slowly ascend the stairs.
403	18	I would then freeze with fear.
403	19	Once she got almost close enough to touch me I would sprint into my parents bedroom and jump into their bed.
403	20	This is were the dream would then end and unusually enough when I awoke I would be in my parents bed.
403	21	I must clearly have been sleep walking.
403	22	Anyway one night that this dream occurred, instead of immediately running I swung my fist at this spectral women.
403	23	This, however seemed to have little effect and I ran as usual.
403	24	This was the last night that this dream occurred.
403	25	I remember this dream being terrifying when I was younger and I like to think that the fact that I retaliated despite it having no effect meant that I faced my fears and refused to give in.
